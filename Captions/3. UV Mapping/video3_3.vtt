WEBVTT

00:00.690 --> 00:03.970
For the arms and legs we're gonna do something a little bit different.

00:04.110 --> 00:10.530
As I mentioned these still have the mirror modifier on them both the legs and the arms and the way we're

00:10.530 --> 00:15.900
gonna do this is since they're going to be symmetrical they're going to look exactly the same on the

00:15.900 --> 00:16.970
left and the right.

00:17.130 --> 00:22.720
We're just going to use v map one side and then we'll go through the entire process of packing all the

00:22.720 --> 00:29.610
U V islands into one u v map and when we're all done with that we're gonna come back and re add the

00:29.610 --> 00:31.860
mirror modifier and apply it.

00:31.980 --> 00:38.700
And what that will do is that will put the U V island of say the arms the left and the right on top

00:38.700 --> 00:45.840
of each other basically reducing by half the amount of space on the texture map that the arms will take

00:46.440 --> 00:52.830
and we'll do the same thing with the legs so we'll stack the U V islands of the legs one on top of the

00:52.830 --> 00:59.220
other as well and that just helps reduce the amount of space we need for the U V islands and therefore

00:59.220 --> 01:06.510
increasing the resolution for everything that's on there and this happens quite a bit for 3D objects

01:06.540 --> 01:14.040
3D characters that are symmetrical to begin let's just remove the mirror modifiers for the legs and

01:14.040 --> 01:22.200
the arms and let's maybe begin with the leg here I'll just press the division key again to isolate it

01:22.700 --> 01:30.360
with press control a and apply the scale it's tab and edit mode and let's see what we can do here I

01:30.360 --> 01:32.490
think we could probably.

01:32.490 --> 01:41.900
Well first of all I'll just select these edges down here and let's go ahead and add a seam to the bottom.

01:41.900 --> 01:53.170
Here control e Mark seem we go next I think let's just add a seam all the way around on this side as

01:53.170 --> 01:53.660
well.

01:53.680 --> 02:03.820
So once again all shift click all the way around to here and let's press control e and Marcus seam here

02:04.880 --> 02:11.810
and then let's go do that on the other side as well so let's press Alt and click there.

02:12.960 --> 02:25.700
And I'll go ahead and select these and here and here and then we need to select this area right in here.

02:26.110 --> 02:34.820
And these individual ones right here and here and here and here.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.670
And let's see how this works.

02:36.800 --> 02:43.360
I'll press control e and Mark seam and let's go ahead and give it a try.

02:43.360 --> 02:49.050
I'll press a to select everything you and unwrap.

02:49.190 --> 02:52.680
Yeah that doesn't look too bad actually.

02:52.880 --> 03:01.160
This seems ok I've extended this out right here this right here you can see it right there.

03:01.300 --> 03:04.210
So that's this piece right there.

03:04.390 --> 03:05.580
I think that's so.

03:06.550 --> 03:13.780
The only thing that seems a little odd to me is this whole piece right here if we think all a you can

03:13.780 --> 03:21.310
see that it extends all the way over the top and I don't know that we need to do that because this area

03:21.340 --> 03:23.200
up here isn't really going to be seen.

03:23.200 --> 03:31.330
So we could go ahead and add a seam to this one edge control e Mark seam and then that will split it

03:31.330 --> 03:33.100
up into two pieces.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.030
So let's try this.

03:34.060 --> 03:38.100
Let's select everything you and unwrap.

03:38.130 --> 03:38.480
Yeah.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.290
So that splits it up into two pieces here.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.750
Okay let's now work on the arm.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.850
I'll tap back into object mode.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.800
Hit the division key and let's select the arm.

03:48.820 --> 03:51.750
Now this is really made up of two pieces.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.640
One is the hand and the other is the arm.

03:54.640 --> 04:00.390
So perhaps what we should do is tab in edit mode and maybe select this piece.

04:00.400 --> 04:06.020
Just the hand I'll hover over this and press the L key to select that whole piece.

04:06.280 --> 04:13.780
And then what we could do is press shift H and that will hide everything that isn't selected so not

04:13.780 --> 04:20.740
only did we isolate it with the division key but now we've pressed shift H to hide everything that isn't

04:20.740 --> 04:21.360
selected.

04:22.240 --> 04:22.710
Okay.

04:22.740 --> 04:33.470
So for this we could probably split this along this edge here I'll press Alt and click and I'll shift

04:33.470 --> 04:44.660
and click all along here so we have this piece of press control e and Mark seem let's grab this piece

04:44.660 --> 04:45.590
down here

04:48.810 --> 04:52.150
this edge right along here and this right here.

04:52.830 --> 05:05.400
So let's mark that seem and then we should probably split this maybe right here so we're splitting the

05:05.400 --> 05:15.130
inside from the outside of the hand here with this seam alt click control e Mark seem so we're going

05:15.130 --> 05:24.890
to have this piece right in here as its own piece and then I think we could just split this right here

05:24.920 --> 05:31.640
just give it a seam around the wrist Mark seam there and then we should open this up.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.130
So it isn't just a a circle.

05:34.130 --> 05:37.940
Let's go ahead and give this a seam right here as well.

05:37.940 --> 05:39.380
Yeah let's do that.

05:39.380 --> 05:44.080
So it opens up that cylinder flat All right let's give it a try.

05:44.080 --> 05:50.230
I'm going to tap back into object mode first and press control a and apply the scale and I'll tab back

05:50.230 --> 05:52.150
into edit mode.

05:52.150 --> 05:56.430
That's the A key press you and unwrap and yeah.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.000
That looks actually pretty good.

05:58.000 --> 06:07.050
We've got the outside or the edges of the hand here the inside and then the outside and then the wrist

06:07.050 --> 06:09.680
is laid out flat here.

06:09.690 --> 06:09.970
All right.

06:09.990 --> 06:11.400
I think that'll work.

06:11.400 --> 06:16.770
Let's take a look at the arm now so to bring the arm back while we're still here in edit mode.

06:16.770 --> 06:18.560
I'll press Alt H.

06:18.770 --> 06:20.790
And that brings that back.

06:20.790 --> 06:25.140
Now I can deselect everything and then hover over the arm and press the L key.

06:25.230 --> 06:30.420
And now once again we can press shift H to hide the UN selected part.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.370
Now okay.

06:32.390 --> 06:39.320
So for this we should probably try and hide a seam in here by the torso.

06:39.390 --> 06:40.130
Right.

06:40.290 --> 06:47.610
So let's press Alt and click this edge and that will select that edge in here by the body.

06:47.610 --> 06:55.140
We probably don't need these so I'm going D select these with shift click and then I'm going to press

06:55.230 --> 07:01.110
Alt shift and click here to select that edge right around there.

07:01.170 --> 07:01.410
Yeah.

07:01.440 --> 07:09.390
Let's give this a try and press control e Mark seem we've already applied the scale for the whole object

07:09.390 --> 07:11.020
of the arm and the hand.

07:11.160 --> 07:15.060
So I think we could just select everything and let's try it again.

07:15.060 --> 07:18.700
Let's hit you and unwrap.

07:18.830 --> 07:26.460
Now we're getting some pulling here and if we switch from conform all to angle based that helps a little.

07:26.690 --> 07:31.790
But let's apply that UVA test pattern to this and see how it looks.

07:31.910 --> 07:37.920
To do that with this here I could come over to this pole down and we can select that material.

07:38.120 --> 07:43.170
We had a call that material something I'll call it UVA test here.

07:43.190 --> 07:47.840
So we've just applied that material to this object now.

07:48.050 --> 07:52.210
And now let's come over to our look devil.

07:52.340 --> 07:58.340
Once again middle mouse button click and drag to move that header over and let's select.

07:58.340 --> 08:07.100
Look Dev right here and there we can see our test pattern you can see it's kind of wobbly and stretched

08:07.100 --> 08:10.390
here up around this cylinder.

08:10.550 --> 08:14.360
Let's switch it to conform and see what we see here.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.380
Not a lot.

08:15.380 --> 08:23.380
It looks like it threw away our material let's go ahead and select that material again there we go so

08:23.530 --> 08:31.090
once again we've got some pulling here around this cylinder as well so it would probably behoove us

08:31.690 --> 08:37.600
to go ahead and split this cylinder out just from the rest of the arm.

08:37.750 --> 08:46.460
So I'm going to all click this edge right here and press shift e and let's Marcus seam here and let's

08:46.460 --> 08:53.960
see how this works so I'm going to once again press the A key to select everything.

08:53.960 --> 09:01.930
Press you and unwrap and let's see how that works out that works out a little bit better I think.

09:01.930 --> 09:09.790
Let me press you and unwrap it again and let's switch from informal to angle based and actually angle

09:09.790 --> 09:12.750
based seems a little bit better to me.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.000
Well let's give this a try all right.

09:17.530 --> 09:20.690
And there we have the whole arm now.

09:20.720 --> 09:28.660
I'll go ahead and switch back to the solid display and let's hit the division key and there we have

09:28.660 --> 09:28.740
it.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.540
We've got our entire character now.

09:31.660 --> 09:33.010
You v mapped.

09:33.010 --> 09:40.170
Each piece has its own u v map with its own individual u v islands.

09:40.270 --> 09:46.950
So what we need to do now is combine all of these together into one u v map.

09:47.020 --> 09:52.640
I see that the arm is still split out or the hand is still hidden away.

09:52.690 --> 09:55.690
Let's press old H to bring that back.

09:55.720 --> 10:04.640
There we go so in the next video what let's do is take all of these objects combine them together and

10:04.640 --> 10:12.640
then will arrange and pack all of those u v islands that we've created into one single u v map.
