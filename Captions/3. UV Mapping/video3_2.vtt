WEBVTT

00:00.670 --> 00:02.330
Let's now work on the head.

00:02.410 --> 00:08.470
Let's select the hair and I'll hit that division key again to isolate it.

00:08.830 --> 00:13.360
And for this sense we don't have it connecting up in the inside.

00:13.360 --> 00:16.360
We've deleted these inside bases.

00:16.360 --> 00:23.290
I think it's gonna be a lot easier to just select everything and hit you and unwrap bullets first.

00:23.290 --> 00:30.820
Come over here to the side bar and make sure we've got our scale uniform and we do it's all ones that's

00:30.820 --> 00:31.570
good.

00:31.660 --> 00:40.090
So let's tap back into edit mode at the achy key and then let's select you and unwrap and then we go.

00:40.090 --> 00:41.180
Well that's not too bad.

00:41.180 --> 00:43.160
It laid it out pretty flat.

00:43.180 --> 00:48.250
We can change from Angle base to informal and see if there's a difference.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.320
And there is for this.

00:50.560 --> 00:55.130
So which one should we choose which one would be better.

00:55.150 --> 01:01.780
Well to decide we're really going to have to apply a test pattern to it and see which one is stretched

01:01.840 --> 01:03.550
the least to do that.

01:03.550 --> 01:08.580
Let's come up here and hover right over here and create a new window.

01:08.710 --> 01:12.660
And what I'd like to do is just create a node Ed..

01:12.850 --> 01:19.270
So let's come over here and pull this down and let's switch to a shader Ed here.

01:19.270 --> 01:22.080
I'll hit the in key to close this panel.

01:22.330 --> 01:27.870
And what we need to do is create a material so we can see the nodes of that material.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.430
Now we can create a material here.

01:30.430 --> 01:35.090
In addition there's a material panel over here and we can create the material here.

01:35.170 --> 01:37.150
So either one is fine.

01:37.360 --> 01:39.070
I'll go ahead and click new.

01:39.070 --> 01:45.790
Right over here and you can see the material here visible over here as well.

01:45.790 --> 01:54.040
So to create a test texture let's come down into the image editor here and click new create a new image

01:54.400 --> 02:01.990
and we get this window here where we can give it a new name let's call it UVA test pattern and the width

02:01.990 --> 02:05.410
and height are fine at 10 24.

02:05.410 --> 02:10.860
But the generated type we want to switch from blank to being a UVA grid.

02:10.900 --> 02:12.650
So let's select that.

02:12.940 --> 02:21.270
And then when we click OK we get this we get a a texture pattern here that we can apply to our object.

02:21.400 --> 02:28.210
Now to apply it to our object we're gonna have to create an image node here and connect it up to the

02:28.210 --> 02:29.260
base color.

02:29.260 --> 02:30.190
So let's do that.

02:30.190 --> 02:38.080
Let's press shift a and then create a texture image texture and I'll drag right over here and put it

02:38.080 --> 02:39.490
right there.

02:39.700 --> 02:46.150
We can then pull this menu down and see all of our images that we've used so far in the project.

02:46.210 --> 02:48.930
And here is our UVA test pattern.

02:48.940 --> 02:49.880
There we go.

02:49.900 --> 02:53.770
Now I just need to connect it up from here to here.

02:53.830 --> 03:00.760
Now that we've applied it to our material we need to just change our view here so we can see it.

03:00.790 --> 03:08.770
I'm going to middle mouse button click and hold and drag TO MOVE THIS BAR OVER AND I CAN CHOOSE THIS

03:08.770 --> 03:09.350
RIGHT HERE.

03:09.370 --> 03:12.130
THIS IS THE LOOK div display.

03:12.310 --> 03:18.310
So I click that and now we can see that test pattern here on our object.

03:18.310 --> 03:18.600
All right.

03:18.610 --> 03:26.530
So we need to now UVA map this again to be able to get that little panel down here that we can switch

03:26.530 --> 03:30.030
from Angle based to conform all to see how we're doing.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.460
I'll also hit the A key over here just so we can see it here.

03:33.490 --> 03:33.980
All right.

03:34.090 --> 03:42.960
So I'm going to hit you and unwrap and now we can switch between angle based and can formal.

03:43.100 --> 03:48.740
Well it looks like conform maybe a little bit better.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.300
I think I'll go with conformance here.

03:51.590 --> 03:52.600
All right.

03:52.730 --> 04:00.320
So that's how we can test are you v map to make sure that we have as little stretching in our 2D textures

04:00.440 --> 04:01.420
as possible.

04:01.580 --> 04:08.030
Because if there's stretching on our texture here on our test pattern that we're applying to the material

04:08.480 --> 04:13.280
there will also be stretching on our final textures that we're applying as well.

04:13.280 --> 04:17.730
So we want to take care of any of the stretching here first.

04:17.750 --> 04:25.160
All right well I'll tap back into object mode and then I'll hit that division key and we can select

04:25.250 --> 04:26.850
another object here.

04:26.960 --> 04:33.980
I'll go ahead and select the head and hit the division key and let's see if we can you v map this as

04:33.980 --> 04:34.730
well.

04:34.880 --> 04:43.790
I'll remove the U V test pattern out of this view for now by hitting the X. And we go and I'll tap into

04:43.790 --> 04:51.620
edit mode and for this I kind of feel like at the back of the head would be the best place to put a

04:51.620 --> 04:52.190
seam.

04:52.190 --> 04:58.130
So I'm going to come back here to the back of the head and press Alt and click and put a seam at the

04:58.130 --> 05:01.340
back and then up here.

05:01.340 --> 05:04.250
I don't think we need the seam to go all the way up.

05:04.250 --> 05:12.050
I think we just need it to go along here so I'm going to press Ault and click and I'll shift and click

05:12.050 --> 05:14.360
to get these edges.

05:14.360 --> 05:21.590
Now I guess I do need an edge right here so or a seam right there so many press control e and Marcus

05:21.590 --> 05:28.970
seem so now you can see I've got a seam going all the way along the back and then I've split that top

05:28.970 --> 05:32.600
cylinder up with these two seams as well.

05:32.600 --> 05:39.470
Let's do that now on the bottom so I'll select this edge right here and let's remove this seam I didn't

05:39.470 --> 05:40.240
mean to do that.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.840
So it's press control e and clear seam.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.770
We can do that there.

05:46.010 --> 05:54.050
Then let's press Alt and click here and I'll shift click here and let's add seams down here Mark seen.

05:54.120 --> 05:58.220
OK so now we've got a seam going along the back.

05:58.220 --> 06:02.240
I do that so I can hide the seams as much as possible.

06:02.450 --> 06:09.770
The main things you want to do with you v mapping is avoid stretching or minimize any stretching of

06:09.770 --> 06:14.720
the texture and hide your seems so they aren't as clearly visible.

06:14.970 --> 06:15.240
All right.

06:15.270 --> 06:21.900
So now that we've got this done let's hit a test like everything you can see the U V map lay out here

06:21.900 --> 06:24.920
for that original cylinder we created.

06:25.140 --> 06:33.270
But now let's hit you and unwrap and oh look it says object has non uniform scale and look at what it

06:33.270 --> 06:37.650
did it kind of created it in a strange manner here.

06:37.650 --> 06:43.500
And if we hit angle based and then conform all you can see there's quite a bit of a difference between

06:43.500 --> 06:48.420
the two and that's another sign that we may not have applied our scale.

06:48.420 --> 06:49.760
So let's do that.

06:49.950 --> 06:53.180
Let's tap back into object mode press control a.

06:53.340 --> 06:59.880
Apply the scale tab back into edit mode and let's hit you and unwrap.

06:59.970 --> 07:05.910
Now we can see that the angle based and conform all just flip.

07:05.920 --> 07:06.370
Really.

07:06.370 --> 07:08.320
But that's not too bad.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.970
I think I like can formal a little bit better yeah.

07:11.980 --> 07:13.640
Let's go with that.

07:13.690 --> 07:14.080
All right.

07:14.110 --> 07:15.760
So I'll tap back into object mode.

07:15.760 --> 07:25.090
Hit the division key and let's go back to the solid display and I guess let's go ahead and do the torso

07:25.090 --> 07:25.360
now.

07:25.360 --> 07:31.900
I'll hit the division key and let's press control a to make sure we've got this scale applied.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.060
There we go.

07:33.190 --> 07:36.410
And now tab into edit mode and let's see if we can do here.

07:36.460 --> 07:48.110
I think for this maybe we can select these edges on the top along here like this control e marks seem

07:49.850 --> 07:54.480
and maybe we can select these edges down here.

07:54.770 --> 08:02.190
I'm just holding the shift key to select these control e marks seem.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.030
There we go.

08:04.020 --> 08:05.680
And let's.

08:05.720 --> 08:15.380
Now select this edge right here and then what I'm going to do is come all the way down to here and control

08:15.380 --> 08:22.230
click this edge and if I control click you can see it connects everything up between those two edges.

08:22.340 --> 08:30.560
So I'll then press control e and Mark seam and the same thing over here I'll select this edge go all

08:30.560 --> 08:31.500
the way down.

08:31.580 --> 08:40.770
Press Control click and it connects all of those up and select all of that control e Mark seem OK.

08:40.910 --> 08:44.100
So let's see how we've done.

08:44.210 --> 08:49.370
I'll hit the a key and press you and unwrap and there we go.

08:49.370 --> 08:59.160
So now we have this whole front part here all one piece this piece right here and then all the other

08:59.160 --> 09:04.760
pieces split out as well the back in the top and the bottom.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.490
All right.

09:05.490 --> 09:13.270
So that looks pretty good I'll hit the division key and in the next video what let's do is work on the

09:13.270 --> 09:16.720
pieces of the character that have been mirrored.

09:16.720 --> 09:24.400
Remember that this arm if we go to the modifiers panel still has a mirror modifier on it as well as

09:24.400 --> 09:28.930
the legs and we'll talk about what we're gonna do with these in the next video.
