WEBVTT

00:00.710 --> 00:01.070
All right.

00:01.070 --> 00:02.150
Now comes the fun part.

00:02.150 --> 00:07.170
We're going to take all of this and make one u v map out of all these u v islands.

00:07.220 --> 00:13.280
So to do that we need to combine all these objects together so I'm just going to begin selecting all

00:13.280 --> 00:20.890
of these the head the hair the torso the arms the leg everything.

00:20.890 --> 00:27.080
And I'm going to press control J to join these all into one object so control J.

00:27.290 --> 00:28.410
And there we go.

00:28.430 --> 00:30.590
PENN It turns out it's all called hair.

00:30.650 --> 00:34.010
Let's let's just call this character for now.

00:34.090 --> 00:39.940
Here in the outlier it looks like we've got a couple of issues with our smoothing.

00:39.940 --> 00:47.440
Once we did that and that's fine we can come over here and go to Object data normals turn on auto smooth

00:48.040 --> 00:50.410
and that cleans it up quite a bit.

00:50.410 --> 01:00.110
We can drag this up maybe I'll drag it up almost to 90 not quite 90 because the next year I wanted to

01:00.110 --> 01:03.290
keep that hard edge there.

01:03.290 --> 01:08.940
So just under 80 it looks like and that looks pretty good all the way around.

01:09.010 --> 01:09.340
OK.

01:09.370 --> 01:17.200
So now that we've done that if we tap into edit mode look at what we have a total mess.

01:17.200 --> 01:25.630
So what we need to do is combine all of these UVA islands together so that they all fit here into the

01:25.630 --> 01:29.460
zero to one space and there is no overlap.

01:29.470 --> 01:35.620
Now the reason why I call this the zero to one the space you can see if we take the 2D cursor and we

01:35.620 --> 01:38.890
place it currently you can see it's at 0 0.

01:38.890 --> 01:45.550
If I then come over here and choose 3d cursor or scuse me cursor it's now the 2D cursor here.

01:45.700 --> 01:48.370
I can move it to right here.

01:48.370 --> 01:54.040
You can see now that's 1 0 whereas x is 1 and Y is zero.

01:54.040 --> 01:59.170
We can take it and type in 1 and 0 and it's right here.

01:59.200 --> 02:08.770
Now we can enter one in here and it moves up to this corner and then we can enter zero here and it moves

02:08.770 --> 02:09.370
over here.

02:09.370 --> 02:14.740
So in terms of a graph this is 0 0.

02:14.740 --> 02:16.790
And this is one and one.

02:16.810 --> 02:20.060
So this is called the zero to one space.

02:20.110 --> 02:20.310
All right.

02:20.320 --> 02:23.880
I want to put the cursor back at 0 0.

02:23.900 --> 02:25.240
There we go.

02:25.240 --> 02:30.790
And now what I'll do is come over here and select everything here in the 3D view.

02:30.820 --> 02:34.600
So we have all of our U vs visible over here.

02:34.810 --> 02:40.040
Well then select the a key over here to select all of those you Vs.

02:40.180 --> 02:44.880
And then we can come up here to the U V menu and there are two things we want to do.

02:44.890 --> 02:51.760
We want to average the scale so that the scale of each of the V islands is the same as the relative

02:51.760 --> 02:54.760
scale of our 3D objects.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.050
And then we want to pack.

02:56.050 --> 03:01.020
Islands we want to take all those islands and pack them in to this zero to one space.

03:01.030 --> 03:06.100
So first of all I'm gonna click average island scale and there they are.

03:06.100 --> 03:11.010
And now I want to click pack island and there they are.

03:11.110 --> 03:13.530
Now they're all very tiny.

03:13.530 --> 03:18.820
Remember we changed the margin here so we need to adjust this again.

03:18.840 --> 03:23.390
I'm going to type in point 0 0 1 and let's see how that works.

03:24.330 --> 03:27.240
And that brings them quite a bit closer together.

03:27.420 --> 03:29.190
That may be a little bit too close.

03:29.220 --> 03:30.810
Let me try.

03:31.050 --> 03:33.820
Point 0 1.

03:33.840 --> 03:34.310
There we go.

03:34.310 --> 03:38.690
So that moves them apart from each other just a little bit.

03:38.700 --> 03:39.480
So there we go.

03:39.480 --> 03:46.760
There is our combined or unified UV map that the inky to close this panel.

03:46.770 --> 03:52.290
Now what we can do is mirror the arms and the legs over again but this is going to take a little bit

03:52.290 --> 03:53.750
of finagling.

03:53.850 --> 04:01.110
We're gonna have to split these out into their own objects again mirror it over and then combine them

04:01.110 --> 04:05.450
back and what that'll do is allow say the arm.

04:05.460 --> 04:15.030
Let me select the arm here that will allow the U V islands of this arm to be in the exact same position

04:15.090 --> 04:18.090
as the U V islands for the arm on the right.

04:18.090 --> 04:23.140
So each of these u v islands will be one right on top of the other.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.860
And that's what we want.

04:24.870 --> 04:32.430
So what we need to do is select both the arm and the hand right here and we need to split this object

04:32.550 --> 04:35.490
out from the rest of the object.

04:35.640 --> 04:42.340
So to do that we just need to press the p key and then we need to separate by selection.

04:42.780 --> 04:43.870
And there we go.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.150
Now a tab back into object mode and vice like this.

04:47.310 --> 04:48.800
That is its own object.

04:48.810 --> 04:51.690
You can see the new object out here.

04:51.810 --> 04:58.680
Now we need to once again move this origin to the 3d cursor here in the center of the grid.

04:58.710 --> 05:07.560
We can of course snap the cursor by pressing shift s and saying cursor to world origin then we can move

05:07.560 --> 05:10.530
the origin by coming up here to object set.

05:10.560 --> 05:19.020
Origin origin to 3d cursor and then we can mirror this over so I'll come over here to the modifiers

05:19.020 --> 05:23.250
panel add modifier mirror.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.930
And there it is right there.

05:25.780 --> 05:27.980
I'll then apply it.

05:28.040 --> 05:31.580
Now it's included in this object here.

05:31.640 --> 05:36.340
Then what we need to do is join it back to the rest of the objects.

05:36.350 --> 05:43.270
So with these selected I'll shift select the character and then I'll press control J.

05:43.280 --> 05:47.030
And that moves it back into that object.

05:47.030 --> 05:48.480
Now watch this.

05:48.530 --> 05:56.870
We tap back into edit mode if the a key you can see that the U the islands of the arms and the hands

05:56.870 --> 06:01.520
are in the exact same place both the left and the right.

06:01.520 --> 06:09.650
So if I say select this right here and if I select this right here with the L key there in the same

06:09.650 --> 06:10.590
place.

06:10.790 --> 06:15.950
Also the hands will hit the L key and the L key here.

06:15.950 --> 06:17.060
So that's what we wanted.

06:17.060 --> 06:26.310
We wanted these two symmetrical parts of the model to have u v islands one right on top of the other.

06:26.480 --> 06:26.800
All right.

06:26.830 --> 06:30.340
So let's do that again now with the legs.

06:30.500 --> 06:37.090
So I come down here and I'll hover over the leg and I'll press the L key then I'll split it out into

06:37.090 --> 06:44.230
its own object with the p key separate by selection now I'll tab into object mode and select that one

06:44.230 --> 06:46.070
object all right.

06:46.100 --> 06:50.150
So now let's move the origin to the 3d cursor set.

06:50.180 --> 06:53.820
Origin origin the 3d cursor.

06:53.880 --> 07:03.600
Now let's add a mirror modifier let's now apply it and then with the legs selected I'll press shift

07:03.630 --> 07:06.000
and click the rest the character.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.400
Press Control J and we'll add this back into the main character here control J.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.730
There we go.

07:14.730 --> 07:18.430
Now if we tap into edit mode if the key.

07:18.660 --> 07:19.730
There we go.

07:20.190 --> 07:24.540
Now we've got the legs in the exact same place as well.

07:24.540 --> 07:31.840
So once again if I select this leg and this leg you can see there in the exact same place.

07:31.860 --> 07:32.580
So there you go.

07:32.580 --> 07:41.310
That is one way to optimize your u v map by placing the maps or the islands of symmetrical parts one

07:41.610 --> 07:43.730
right on top of the other.

07:43.750 --> 07:44.200
All right.

07:44.200 --> 07:50.860
Well now that we have the U V map taken care of we can now begin thinking about texture painting our

07:50.860 --> 07:51.340
character.
