WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:07.380
Well now that we have the character modeled we can turn our attention to UV mapping now and UV mapping

00:07.380 --> 00:14.460
is just the process of creating a two dimensional representation of your 3D objects.

00:14.460 --> 00:20.150
This is needed especially if you're going to be taking your objects your character into a game engine.

00:20.160 --> 00:27.540
Because at this point in time the predominant way to apply textures and materials to game objects is

00:27.690 --> 00:30.300
with 2D images with textures.

00:30.300 --> 00:34.400
And to apply those textures we're going to have to create a uv map.

00:34.410 --> 00:39.960
So what I'm going to do is go through each of the objects and create a u v map for each one and then

00:39.990 --> 00:46.800
ultimately we're going to combine all the objects together and pack all the movie islands into one movie

00:46.800 --> 00:47.920
map.

00:47.940 --> 00:54.270
Now there's a couple of things I want to clean up first here it looks like I have the hair still over

00:54.270 --> 00:56.470
here as a cube.

00:56.580 --> 00:59.310
So what I want to do is click on that.

00:59.310 --> 01:05.670
Call it hair and I'll just take this and drag it up into the character scene collection or the character

01:05.670 --> 01:06.990
collection.

01:06.990 --> 01:12.300
We can probably turn off the reference image here we don't need to see that I don't think.

01:12.300 --> 01:19.980
And also I'll right click on this border and choose join areas and let's click here and join that back

01:19.980 --> 01:20.460
together.

01:20.460 --> 01:23.650
I don't think we need that right there anymore either.

01:23.730 --> 01:30.720
Now one thing I realized is when we were creating the hips or the belt here one thing I didn't do is

01:30.990 --> 01:37.050
make sure I had all quads or all four sided polygons over the entire object.

01:37.140 --> 01:41.100
I'm going to hit the division key here and isolate this.

01:41.250 --> 01:48.390
So if we tap into edit mode and go to face mode we can see we've got faces of four sides here.

01:48.390 --> 01:51.120
So if I select this you can see way down here.

01:51.120 --> 02:00.770
It says edges for so I've got four edges selected here but if I select this face here you can see down

02:00.770 --> 02:06.380
here edges 11 I've got 11 edges on this one face.

02:06.380 --> 02:10.550
And that's probably not a good idea especially as we're going to use a map this.

02:10.610 --> 02:16.370
So what I'm going to do is add a little bit of geometry to this to make sure that all of the polygons

02:16.400 --> 02:19.260
all of the faces are four sided.

02:19.370 --> 02:29.840
So it looks like what I've got here is one two three four five six seven edges along here and I just

02:29.840 --> 02:37.140
need to extend those edges all the way across the object to connect to the other side.

02:37.220 --> 02:45.260
So what I'll do is press control are and let's add a few edges up here on top and I'll just scroll the

02:45.260 --> 02:54.510
mouse wheel and until I get about seven cut and you can see way down here it says number of cuts seven

02:54.530 --> 02:59.940
so if I put that here and then click and click again.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.720
Now we've added seven edges.

03:02.720 --> 03:03.000
All right.

03:03.020 --> 03:09.380
So what we need to do now is connect these up to the existing edges on the bottom.

03:09.380 --> 03:14.490
To do that I'll switch to face mode and I just want to select this one.

03:14.540 --> 03:22.330
Face this in gone multi sided face and I'm going to delete it X faces.

03:22.520 --> 03:28.940
Now what I gonna do is allow blender to recreate that face while connecting up the new edges.

03:28.940 --> 03:33.090
So if I all click this edge here let me switch to edge mode.

03:33.170 --> 03:37.480
I'll click this edge here that selects that edge all the way around.

03:37.490 --> 03:42.290
Now there are a couple of options to fill this with faces.

03:42.290 --> 03:48.560
One thing I can do is just hit the FCC and that will fill it with one big face but that's what we already

03:48.560 --> 03:49.220
had.

03:49.250 --> 03:54.730
So I don't want that or press controls Z to undo that.

03:54.770 --> 04:05.390
Now if we come up here to the face menu I can come down here and choose Phil or alt F and that fills

04:05.390 --> 04:12.440
it with triangles it does the best it can by just filling it with triangles and that's not what I want

04:12.440 --> 04:12.800
either.

04:12.800 --> 04:20.130
So I'll press control Z or lastly we can come over here to the face menu and we can grid fill.

04:20.390 --> 04:27.360
And if we choose this it will grid fill that and attempt to make it all quads.

04:27.460 --> 04:34.440
And since I have the same number of edges on the top as on the bottom it does a pretty good job.

04:34.990 --> 04:37.660
So I'll come over here and do the same thing.

04:37.660 --> 04:47.750
Let's select that base delete it select this edge with alt click and then I'll come back up to face

04:47.870 --> 04:49.200
and grid fill.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.670
And there we go.

04:50.780 --> 04:52.120
So that's not too bad.

04:52.130 --> 04:55.150
That'll that'll probably work pretty well.

04:55.190 --> 04:59.600
And now that we're here dealing with this let's go ahead and movie map it.

04:59.750 --> 05:03.910
So I'll go over to the UVA editing tab right here.

05:04.070 --> 05:07.430
I'll hit the A key to select everything and hit the period key.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.040
And here we have it here.

05:09.080 --> 05:15.470
I need to isolate it in this view as well so I'll tab into object mode and then press that division

05:15.470 --> 05:17.140
key on the number pad.

05:17.340 --> 05:19.140
Again it didn't do it.

05:19.130 --> 05:20.600
Let me hit it.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.800
There we go.

05:21.800 --> 05:27.260
They still need to work on that but let's tab back into edit mode.

05:27.260 --> 05:36.050
And now what let's do is select edges to create the seams that will be cut so that we can split all

05:36.050 --> 05:41.600
these different faces apart and lay them flat here in the movie editor.

05:41.600 --> 05:49.700
So this right here is where we want to lay our two dimensional representation of our object flat here

05:49.700 --> 05:51.470
in this space.

05:51.530 --> 05:59.120
So I'm going to go to edge mode and I'll also click this edge and shift all click these edges and I'm

05:59.120 --> 06:03.240
just going to select these edges all the way around here.

06:03.410 --> 06:10.070
And if we press control e to bring up the edges menu then we can also do that up here as well.

06:10.190 --> 06:18.620
But I'm going to press control e and choose Mark scene and you can see that gives us a red seam here

06:18.800 --> 06:20.010
on the object.

06:20.030 --> 06:26.870
I'll go ahead and do that over here I'll press Alt and click alt shift click as well to select everything

06:26.900 --> 06:34.230
all around there and then I'll press shift and click these edges right along here as well.

06:34.250 --> 06:40.330
So this is just where we're going to cut the object so that we can lay it down flat.

06:40.430 --> 06:44.220
I'll press control e and Mark seam and there we go.

06:44.240 --> 06:48.770
There we have our seams marked and ready for UV mapping.

06:48.770 --> 06:57.620
So let's select everything with the achy oppressed you to bring up the UVA mapping menu here and let's

06:57.620 --> 07:06.900
just click unwrap look down here it says object has non uniform scale and we've seen that before we

07:06.900 --> 07:08.130
know what that means.

07:08.130 --> 07:17.190
That means if we hit the inky over here and go back to object mode this right here we have non uniform

07:17.250 --> 07:18.330
values.

07:18.330 --> 07:26.510
So once again even with UV mapping that can be a problem to solve that let's press control a and apply

07:26.510 --> 07:27.930
the scale.

07:27.930 --> 07:36.630
Now if we go back into edit mode and press you and click unwrap here let's watch what happens over here

07:36.630 --> 07:43.920
in the movie Ed. notice all the pieces are just square instead of being elongated as they are in the

07:43.920 --> 07:44.710
3D object.

07:45.060 --> 07:51.110
So let's hit you and click unwrap and yeah that looks quite a bit better.

07:51.120 --> 07:56.780
So now we've got all of these objects a little bit more the proper scale and size.

07:57.030 --> 08:00.600
We can also come over here to this unwrap panel right here.

08:00.620 --> 08:09.360
Open that up and we can switch the method of unwrapping from Angle based to conform all and see if that

08:09.360 --> 08:10.920
helps at all.

08:10.920 --> 08:14.060
But there really isn't too much of a difference here.

08:14.130 --> 08:21.810
We can also take the margin and we can change this Let's say instead of point 0 0 1 we want point 0

08:21.810 --> 08:28.770
1 right here and that moves these away from each other just a little bit.

08:28.890 --> 08:35.910
So we could do that again or we could change it to point one right here and it expands that out even

08:35.910 --> 08:36.670
further.

08:36.810 --> 08:42.540
So it doesn't really matter at this point in time because ultimately we're going to combine all of them

08:42.540 --> 08:45.570
together all of the pieces together.

08:45.570 --> 08:45.840
All right.

08:45.870 --> 08:47.490
So we have this.

08:47.510 --> 08:48.330
You've mapped.

08:48.330 --> 08:55.060
Now let's hit the division key and think about what we want to do next.

08:55.230 --> 09:02.940
Let's maybe just do this cylinder here so I'll select it hit the division key I'll tap into edit mode

09:03.030 --> 09:10.440
and this looks pretty good the way it is I'll get the key to select everything but this is still the

09:10.440 --> 09:13.340
original u v map of the cylinder.

09:13.350 --> 09:15.170
When we first created it.

09:15.390 --> 09:21.450
If we hit the end key we can see in object mode that once again the scale is non uniform.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.620
So we need to fix this.

09:23.760 --> 09:32.700
Let's press control a and let's apply the scale and then let's tab back into edit mode and then we can

09:32.700 --> 09:34.830
go about marking our seams.

09:34.830 --> 09:39.860
So let's press Alt and click this edge all shift and click.

09:39.860 --> 09:45.500
This edge and now it's press control e and Mark seem all right.

09:45.500 --> 09:52.470
So now that we have those there and let's go ahead and select everything let's press you and unwrap.

09:52.690 --> 09:59.740
There we go now we're seeing it a little bit differently however this should probably be laid out flat

09:59.800 --> 10:02.260
instead of being here in a circle.

10:02.260 --> 10:08.630
So let's maybe select an edge up in the up in the character where we can't see it.

10:08.650 --> 10:16.510
Let's select this edge let's say in press control e and Marcus seen there and what this will do is split

10:16.510 --> 10:21.040
it there so it will lay it out flat instead of in a circle.

10:21.070 --> 10:27.790
All right let's select it all again it you and unwrap and there we go you can see how it's just laid

10:27.790 --> 10:32.040
out flat now because we cut it at this edge.

10:32.500 --> 10:32.890
All right.

10:32.890 --> 10:35.070
So that looks pretty good.

10:35.090 --> 10:37.310
Let's go ahead and tap back into object mode.

10:37.310 --> 10:42.740
Hit the division key and in the next video will continue you'll be mapping the character.
