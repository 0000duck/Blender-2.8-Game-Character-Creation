00:00.770 --> 00:07.760
Before we create the arm bones I think I'd like to take these arms and rotate them up so they're in

00:07.760 --> 00:09.010
a t pose.

00:09.140 --> 00:15.110
When we take the character into unity it's going to look for a t pose for the character and I think

00:15.110 --> 00:18.030
we need to do that now before we go any further.

00:18.110 --> 00:26.600
So I'm going to select the character and I will tab and edit mode and I think what I need to do is select

00:26.660 --> 00:33.950
just this edge right here I'll ult click it right there and I want to put the cursor at this point so

00:33.950 --> 00:40.610
that I can rotate the arms up around that point right there and I think that will also be where we put

00:40.610 --> 00:47.510
the upper arm joint as well so let's go ahead and press shift s and put the cursor to the selected then

00:47.510 --> 00:57.140
what I'll do is change my pivot point to the 3d cursor and then I want to select this whole arm and

00:57.140 --> 01:04.670
the hand go back to that front view and let's rotate this up and what I want to do is hit the R key

01:04.670 --> 01:06.830
and hold down the control button.

01:06.830 --> 01:14.270
And if you look in the upper left hand corner of the 3D view you can see I'm rotating this snapping

01:14.270 --> 01:19.820
it in increments of 5 degrees and that's just so I can do the other one in the exact same way and I

01:19.820 --> 01:25.060
think if I get the arm about right here looks like that's 70 degrees.

01:25.130 --> 01:28.950
So if I click there and I've got the arm or I want it here.

01:29.060 --> 01:38.050
So all we have to do now is come over to this one do the same thing and rotate it up 70 degrees as well.

01:38.170 --> 01:40.630
Let's go back to that front view.

01:40.630 --> 01:42.540
It's like the arm in the hand.

01:42.690 --> 01:50.060
And now let's hit R and control and let's rotate this one up 70 degrees as well.

01:50.080 --> 01:50.560
There we go.

01:51.130 --> 01:55.110
So now we've got our character in a kind of a tee pose.

01:55.390 --> 02:02.720
Now going to use that same process here to bring the cursor back over to this side cursor to selected

02:02.720 --> 02:08.320
there and I'll change the pivot point back to medium point.

02:08.330 --> 02:13.440
You can also press the period key and get this same menu as well.

02:13.520 --> 02:24.300
So I think what I'll do now is go back to the armature select it and go to edit mode and now when I

02:24.300 --> 02:29.190
create a new bone here it'll pop into the 3d cursor right there.

02:29.190 --> 02:33.120
So let's give it a trial press shift a and there it is.

02:33.210 --> 02:37.240
Now we can take this point and bring it down to the elbow.

02:37.260 --> 02:41.920
So I'll just hit G and bring it down about like this.

02:41.940 --> 02:48.200
Let's zoom in with the period key here and maybe I'll bring it about like this.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.130
So it's more horizontal.

02:50.150 --> 02:55.890
Now let's go back to the top view with the seven key and let's see where we can place this.

02:55.910 --> 03:03.080
Now we have those three edges on this character or on the arm here and that should help us place this

03:03.080 --> 03:06.730
joint but we can't see the edges currently.

03:06.770 --> 03:11.300
So what we need to do is tap back into object mode and select the character.

03:11.450 --> 03:18.860
And if we go over here to viewport display under our object tab we can come down here and check wireframe

03:19.010 --> 03:22.030
and I'll also choose all edges here.

03:22.040 --> 03:28.790
So now when we go back to the armature tab back into edit mode we can see these edges and we can place

03:28.820 --> 03:35.810
our joints more precisely right on this edge right on that edge that will be that elbow.

03:35.810 --> 03:36.050
All right.

03:36.050 --> 03:44.350
So now that I've got this I'm going to hit e and we'll extend this on down to here and then we can hit

03:44.680 --> 03:53.380
B and extend this out for the hand and we go and then we also need to create the bones for the hand

03:53.380 --> 03:54.310
here.

03:54.310 --> 03:56.410
And this is kind of a strange hand.

03:56.410 --> 03:59.200
It's really not much like anything else we might create.

03:59.200 --> 04:03.190
So we're gonna have to kind of wing it here as to how we should do this.

04:03.210 --> 04:11.290
I think what I'm to do is just take this point here and extrude it up maybe one two three times so let's

04:11.290 --> 04:20.160
try that I'll hit e up to hear it again to here and again to here and let's see how that works.

04:20.170 --> 04:23.460
Well it's way off axis on our hand and that's fine.

04:23.470 --> 04:25.860
We need to do some work here.

04:26.020 --> 04:28.780
So let me grab this one and move it.

04:28.810 --> 04:35.970
I'm going to try and move them along this edge here move it like this this like that.

04:35.990 --> 04:36.520
Here we go.

04:36.550 --> 04:39.740
That's a little bit more in line with the hand.

04:39.820 --> 04:41.590
Let's do that again.

04:41.590 --> 04:48.760
I'll select that tip and kind of arrange the view so it's kind of at the side of the hand here.

04:48.760 --> 04:56.860
Again it e there and I'm just trying to place them on these edges here like that.

04:56.890 --> 05:04.770
And then let's go down on the bottom here try and line up the view and we'll try and place these along

05:04.770 --> 05:08.930
that edge as well and we go.

05:08.930 --> 05:09.290
All right.

05:09.320 --> 05:14.330
So we have those before we mirror these over to the other side.

05:14.360 --> 05:17.040
We should do the legs as well.

05:17.090 --> 05:25.010
So for these I think we also want to place that route joint or that upper leg joint right in the center

05:25.010 --> 05:26.410
of this cylinder.

05:26.450 --> 05:32.870
So what we need to do once again is tab back into object mode and select the character tab into edit

05:32.870 --> 05:33.320
mode.

05:33.350 --> 05:43.220
Let's go to wireframe and let's see if we can just select these two points right here in here.

05:43.250 --> 05:44.260
Let's try this.

05:44.270 --> 05:48.290
And I think if we place the cursor right here we'll be pretty good.

05:48.470 --> 05:52.600
So let's press shift s and cursor to selected.

05:52.700 --> 05:53.930
All right.

05:53.930 --> 06:02.230
Now let's go back here select that armature if the tab key to go back into edit mode.

06:02.240 --> 06:07.710
And now here in the front view again I'm going to create the bone at that cursor.

06:07.730 --> 06:09.390
So shift a.

06:09.650 --> 06:14.090
And now let's take this guy and just move it down to the knee.

06:14.150 --> 06:20.630
I think what I'll do is I'll try and hit G and press control and it will kind of snap down here and

06:20.630 --> 06:22.700
hopefully it'll be straight up and down.

06:22.700 --> 06:22.950
Yeah.

06:22.970 --> 06:25.220
That looks pretty vertical there.

06:25.220 --> 06:30.680
So I'll bring that up to the knee joint and then let's go to the side view.

06:30.860 --> 06:37.370
And up here with the arm joint we kind of automatically created a bend here because the arm was already

06:37.370 --> 06:46.400
bent down here at the leg the leg is just purely straight but we're gonna need a bend here in this one

06:46.760 --> 06:52.790
especially because I'm going to put inverse Kana Maddox or an i k chain on the leg.

06:52.790 --> 06:58.310
I won't do it on the arms because I think it'll be better to use forward Kenny Maddox but I want to

06:58.310 --> 07:07.160
use Ike here on the legs so I need a slight bend in the leg so blender knows in its calculations which

07:07.160 --> 07:11.710
way the leg is supposed to bend so I'll pull this forward just a bit.

07:11.720 --> 07:18.170
Kind of like this and then I'll hit e and let's bring this joint down to where the ankle might be right

07:18.170 --> 07:26.690
here and then I'll hit you again bring that down to where the toe might bend and then I'll hit e and

07:26.690 --> 07:29.560
drag this straight out like that.

07:29.630 --> 07:31.070
There we go.

07:31.070 --> 07:34.180
So now we need to go through and name all of these.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.860
So let's begin up here.

07:36.860 --> 07:45.510
This one I'll call up arm dot L and this one will be low arm.

07:45.560 --> 07:50.180
El this one could be just hand.

07:50.320 --> 07:59.600
EL and these I believe what I'm going to do is call these fingers on the top and thumb on the bottom.

07:59.600 --> 08:05.890
Just a way to differentiate them so I'm going to call this finger one dot.

08:05.900 --> 08:13.130
El bat and this one we can call finger to dial

08:16.490 --> 08:18.020
and fingers three dot l

08:21.080 --> 08:22.030
down here.

08:22.100 --> 08:25.680
We're gonna call this thumb one detail

08:29.020 --> 08:31.480
thumb to dot L

08:34.110 --> 08:38.790
and thumb three and we go all right.

08:38.810 --> 08:43.660
So we have those done down here with the leg.

08:43.970 --> 09:00.730
Let's call this up leg dot l this one would be low leg l this one would be foot dot L and then toe dot

09:00.790 --> 09:04.650
L right here and we go.

09:04.650 --> 09:12.150
Okay so now we have these pretty much set up that is really all of the bones that we're gonna need for

09:12.150 --> 09:14.280
this very simple character.

09:14.280 --> 09:21.240
So in the next video what let's do is let's mirror these over to the other side and let's parent the

09:21.240 --> 09:23.700
arm and the legs to the main torso.
