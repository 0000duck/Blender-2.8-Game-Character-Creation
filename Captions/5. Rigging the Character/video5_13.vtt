WEBVTT

00:00.530 --> 00:02.260
Let's continue now with the arms.

00:02.270 --> 00:07.970
And for these we're going to create the bones sticking straight up so we won't have to turn them for

00:07.970 --> 00:10.900
these Let's select one of these.

00:10.910 --> 00:19.430
Move the cursor to it cursor to selected shift a and then if we select the bone now with our active

00:19.430 --> 00:28.980
element selected we can hit s and scale this down quite a bit let's do the same thing here cursor to

00:28.980 --> 00:43.190
selected I'll press shift a select bone it s and bring it down like so we'll get the risk bone here

00:43.220 --> 00:52.290
as well and I'm creating all of these in the front view just so they're consistent shift a select s

00:52.560 --> 01:02.730
scaled down like this now we need to do a similar thing for each of the finger bones this can get a

01:02.730 --> 01:11.970
little tedious but it is well worth it I think so let's select this tip right here move the cursor to

01:11.970 --> 01:19.790
it I'm going to go to the front view again shift a and let's scale this one down

01:25.600 --> 01:31.290
it's like this cursor to selected shift a

01:34.110 --> 01:34.770
look down

01:37.880 --> 01:39.500
and then this one as well

01:44.740 --> 01:45.760
and scale it down.

01:45.760 --> 01:51.160
Now the good thing is is once we get them all done on one side we're gonna just mirror them over so

01:51.160 --> 01:59.170
we don't have to worry too much about it I'm gonna get this right here let's move the cursor to it and

01:59.170 --> 02:08.900
we go shift a s and scale this down now what I am gonna do for these is take this right here and just

02:08.900 --> 02:09.950
move it straight down.

02:09.950 --> 02:17.500
So I'm gonna hit G and Z and just drag straight down like that and we go just so we can see it a little

02:17.500 --> 02:28.600
better let's move the cursor to this one shift a scale down and as I said I'll just drag this g into

02:28.600 --> 02:31.020
the drag it down like that.

02:34.050 --> 02:43.230
Move the cursor once again create the bone scale it down grab that tip Gee and easy and drag it straight

02:43.230 --> 02:44.190
down.

02:44.220 --> 02:46.670
Okay so there we have the hands.

02:46.800 --> 02:55.410
We need to take these and move these up above the hands just a bit because our control objects are going

02:55.410 --> 02:59.120
to hover over and under the hand just a bit.

02:59.130 --> 03:08.920
So I will just take these and move these up like this and I will take these and move these down like

03:08.920 --> 03:12.820
this just a little bit outside of the hand there.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.390
All right let's keep going.

03:15.390 --> 03:22.780
I will create a control object for the foot control right here.

03:22.830 --> 03:26.220
Let's go ahead and select this tip right there.

03:26.310 --> 03:31.910
Let's take the cursor to it and then what let's do is create the bone.

03:31.910 --> 03:34.890
However I don't think that'll work.

03:34.970 --> 03:42.890
We want the center of that control object to be right at the base of the foot when we take that control

03:42.890 --> 03:45.650
object and zero out the transforms.

03:45.650 --> 03:49.270
We want to know that it's flat on the ground.

03:49.350 --> 03:55.830
So what we should probably do instead is actually select the bottom of the foot and move the cursor

03:55.830 --> 03:57.100
to it.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.130
Let's take a look at that.

03:59.060 --> 04:02.190
I'll tap back into object mode and select the character.

04:02.190 --> 04:10.650
And now it's tab and edit mode and I'm thinking that what we should do is select these points right

04:10.710 --> 04:11.810
along here.

04:11.910 --> 04:22.510
These two edges and if we change our pivot point to median point and go back to the move tool you can

04:22.510 --> 04:26.770
see where the center of that selection is.

04:26.860 --> 04:29.850
Now I think maybe we want it more like here.

04:29.860 --> 04:35.050
If we select just that edge maybe that's where we want it.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.450
We could select this edge again and yeah that moves it over a little too much.

04:39.450 --> 04:42.100
I kind of like it right there.

04:42.280 --> 04:49.090
So let's just move that cursor to this point now shift s cursor to selected.

04:49.360 --> 04:49.780
Yeah.

04:49.780 --> 04:52.630
Now that's the way we want it.

04:52.660 --> 04:56.110
We don't want this particular control to be up at the ankle.

04:56.230 --> 04:59.190
We want it to be right flat on the ground.

04:59.290 --> 04:59.570
All right.

04:59.650 --> 05:01.480
So now let's create this bone.

05:01.480 --> 05:08.620
Let's go back to the rig and then we go to edit mode here with the cursor there.

05:08.650 --> 05:11.740
Let's press shift a and there's our bone.

05:12.100 --> 05:21.820
Let's select it change back to active element and now we can scale this down but in addition we need

05:21.820 --> 05:25.340
to rotate it back so it's flat on the ground.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.260
So let's do that.

05:26.290 --> 05:31.960
Let's go to our rotate tool click and control and let's turn that down.

05:31.960 --> 05:38.380
Ninety degrees there and maybe I'll take this and move it back.

05:38.410 --> 05:45.780
Let's take this and move it straight back I mean go back to our median point and I just want to move

05:45.780 --> 05:50.440
this straight back like this something like that.

05:50.470 --> 05:51.130
There we go.

05:51.220 --> 06:01.240
OK so this is now going to be called we'll call this foot control underscore CEO control object.

06:01.330 --> 06:05.200
Now did I name these up here.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.340
No I did not.

06:06.340 --> 06:11.030
So we're going to need to go through and name all of these as well.

06:11.140 --> 06:26.240
Let's call this up arm underscore CEO dot l will call this low arm underscore SEO dot l.

06:26.600 --> 06:35.240
This one we will call hand underscore SEO dot L and then we're gonna do all of these.

06:35.250 --> 06:47.830
So let's do a finger 1 underscore SEO for control object dot l This will be finger 2 underscore SEO

06:48.130 --> 06:51.970
dot l finger 3

06:55.870 --> 06:56.560
dot l.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.470
There we go and now these down here.

06:59.470 --> 07:09.280
You know let me just type in thumb 1 underscore SEO dot L and then I'll just select this I should make

07:09.280 --> 07:17.980
that a 1 then I will select this press control see the copy and now select this click their press control

07:17.980 --> 07:27.110
V and now it can change that one to a 2 and we'll do that here as well control the and change that one

07:27.110 --> 07:30.020
to a 3 and we go.

07:30.020 --> 07:37.930
All right now let's work on these bones so we have this bone here that we're gonna use to control the

07:38.180 --> 07:44.990
but we've got this bone here that we're going to use to control the foot as well or least the toe and

07:44.990 --> 07:50.280
then we have this bone for the knee so we need control objects for all of those as well.

07:50.510 --> 07:52.840
So first of all this one.

07:52.910 --> 08:01.370
Let's just choose this tip right here and move the cursor to it and then I'll switch back to active

08:01.370 --> 08:13.000
element go to the front view press shift a select that bone and let's scale this down like this go to

08:13.000 --> 08:21.430
the side view and I think this will be just fine like this let's give it a name let's call this foot

08:22.150 --> 08:33.760
roll underscore SEO dot L and let's work on the toe so for this if we select this and move the cursor

08:33.760 --> 08:47.920
to it and we go now let's press shift data create the bone let's scale it down and for this one I think

08:47.920 --> 08:55.060
we need it out just a little bit like this let's move it out like this and let's also move it right

08:55.060 --> 09:03.160
about here just one it kind of in front of the toe we're gonna have this one behind the heel and this

09:03.160 --> 09:12.940
one can be up in front of the toe like that so let's call this one toe underscore SEO dot L and we go

09:14.210 --> 09:22.850
and for this one we need a control object out here as well so let's select this bone and move the cursor

09:22.850 --> 09:24.800
to it right here.

09:24.830 --> 09:30.810
Well I'd like it right here at the base of the bone so let's change to individual or excuse me median

09:30.860 --> 09:33.750
points and just select that.

09:33.890 --> 09:42.320
Now let's move the cursor to it and we go and then if we change it back to active element we can press

09:42.380 --> 09:51.540
shift a create the bone select it scale it and this time once again I'm going to grab the tip of this

09:51.540 --> 09:59.340
bone and pull it straight down so cheesy and drop it down below like that OK.

09:59.360 --> 10:06.140
So this one is going to be knee underscore SEO dot l.

10:06.470 --> 10:07.130
All right.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.970
So do we have everything.

10:09.230 --> 10:20.510
We've got the knee the toe the foot control the foot roll we've got the hips the two bones of the torso

10:21.140 --> 10:23.750
the arms and the hands.

10:23.810 --> 10:25.710
I think that's it.

10:25.730 --> 10:32.930
So what let's do in the next video is select all the bones on the left side of the character and mirror

10:32.930 --> 10:37.210
them over to the right and then we'll begin parenting the bones.

10:37.280 --> 10:42.920
So the control objects will eventually move with the character and the characters limbs.
