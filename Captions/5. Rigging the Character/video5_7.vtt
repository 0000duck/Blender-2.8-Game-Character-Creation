WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:06.790
The most complicated part of the rig is going to be the foot roll here and what we want to do with that

00:06.790 --> 00:14.650
is be able to plant the foot on the heel roll it forward and have it roll forward up onto the toes up

00:14.650 --> 00:18.030
onto the ball of the toe and roll back to the heel again.

00:18.850 --> 00:23.310
So that particular functionality is going to take a bit to do.

00:23.340 --> 00:26.630
We're going to do this over the next few videos.

00:26.950 --> 00:32.920
And the reason why I'm going to be doing this in a course that is fairly introductory is that I really

00:32.920 --> 00:39.220
think it's important if you're going to animate a character the ability to plant and roll the foot when

00:39.220 --> 00:42.600
you're doing a walk cycle a run a jump.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.940
Anything is really important really adds believability to the animation.

00:47.980 --> 00:54.850
So even though we're going to keep the arms fairly simple with forward Kent Emacs and we'll talk more

00:54.850 --> 00:58.360
about forward cinematics and inverse kind Mannix here in a bit.

00:58.720 --> 01:04.420
Even though we're gonna keep the arms fairly simple we're gonna set up a fairly complex rig for the

01:04.420 --> 01:05.590
feet.

01:05.590 --> 01:09.950
Let's now come out of weight paint mode to object mode here.

01:09.970 --> 01:14.990
And also we don't need our wireframe on the character anymore.

01:15.090 --> 01:19.200
I'll come over here and let's turn off wireframe and all edges.

01:19.210 --> 01:20.960
So we don't see that.

01:21.340 --> 01:27.490
And then let's go back to the rig and let's go to edit mode for the rig here.

01:27.730 --> 01:35.230
What we need to do first is to create an i k chain here on the leg and we'll begin with the left leg

01:35.230 --> 01:36.220
first.

01:36.610 --> 01:45.490
And what I mean by I K or inverse cinematics is the ability to move the limb by just selecting say a

01:45.490 --> 01:51.160
foot bone and moving it around and the other joints on the limb adjust and adapt.

01:51.640 --> 01:57.910
So it's kind of like when someone shakes your hand they can take your hand and move it back and forth

01:58.330 --> 02:06.220
and your elbow and your shoulder adapt and move along with where the hand is as opposed to say forward

02:06.310 --> 02:10.090
cinematics which we will do for the arm.

02:10.090 --> 02:16.300
This is more like a wooden toy if you want the hand to be in a particular place for say a wooden toy

02:16.300 --> 02:22.720
you would have to bend the arm at the shoulder and then at the elbow and then at the wrist to get that

02:22.720 --> 02:29.410
hand in a certain place we'll be using both types of movement on this character so I think you'll get

02:29.560 --> 02:32.530
a better idea of it as we go along.

02:32.800 --> 02:38.320
So to begin our inverse can semantics change here on the left leg.

02:38.350 --> 02:41.670
What we want to do is choose first of all the foot.

02:41.710 --> 02:48.470
And let me go over here to this panel so we can see the names of the bones when we choose them.

02:48.520 --> 02:52.050
We can also see them here which is going to help as well.

02:52.180 --> 02:55.720
First of all here in edit mode let's just duplicate this bone.

02:55.720 --> 03:04.510
I'll press shift D and then enter and now we have this new bone here in the exact same place as the

03:04.510 --> 03:05.530
foot bone.

03:05.530 --> 03:08.050
So let's change the name of this.

03:08.050 --> 03:10.330
Let's call this foot.

03:10.330 --> 03:12.950
I K Dot l.

03:12.980 --> 03:14.290
There we go.

03:14.290 --> 03:22.180
And because we've duplicated this bone off of that main foot bone it still has the parent child relationships

03:22.270 --> 03:24.400
of that original bone.

03:24.640 --> 03:30.040
So it is a child of the lower leg and a parent of the toe.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.010
And we want to clear that away.

03:32.230 --> 03:40.630
So to clear a parent child relationship we can press all the P and then choose clear parent and we go.

03:40.630 --> 03:45.790
So now this bone here is a bone all on its own.

03:45.880 --> 03:49.560
Now for the rest of this setup we're gonna need to go to Poe's mode.

03:49.570 --> 03:53.840
So let's come back over here and go to pose mode.

03:53.840 --> 03:54.710
There we go.

03:55.500 --> 04:01.170
And now we can go back to that original football and I'm going to click right in here and that will

04:01.170 --> 04:06.870
switch me over to the foot dot L that original foot bone.

04:06.870 --> 04:09.890
Now I'm going to come over here to the bone constraints panel.

04:09.900 --> 04:14.000
And here is where we'll add that inverse cinematics constraint.

04:14.250 --> 04:18.460
So I'll click here and let's choose inverse kinetics.

04:18.570 --> 04:27.160
Now for the target we're gonna want it to be the armature and then for the bone we want to control this.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.070
We want to choose that foot.

04:29.070 --> 04:36.930
I K I have it here but we can also just type in f o t to filter the list and choose that foot.

04:36.930 --> 04:46.230
I K L there we have that now it looks kind of crazy like something has gone wrong here and it isn't

04:46.230 --> 04:49.670
that it's gone wrong it's just we haven't completed the setup yet.

04:49.890 --> 04:57.450
So what's happening here is it's using the entire rig as the IAEA chain and we only need it to extend

04:57.930 --> 05:02.730
to the lower leg and the upper leg to bones.

05:02.820 --> 05:05.610
So we need an IKEA chain length of 2.

05:05.680 --> 05:13.440
And here we go chain length right here so let's just increase this to 1 and then 2 and then instead

05:13.440 --> 05:18.830
of using the tail as the last element we'll use the tip of the bone.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.300
So let's uncheck use tail.

05:21.300 --> 05:21.630
All right.

05:21.660 --> 05:22.900
So there we go.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.470
Now we've got that I K chain set up.

05:25.470 --> 05:27.060
So what does that mean.

05:27.060 --> 05:35.880
Well we can come over here and click and let me just turn off that rotation gizmo there and if we click

05:36.150 --> 05:41.740
on the bone and choose that foot I K bone right here you can see it here.

05:41.850 --> 05:44.780
And if I come back over here you can see it here.

05:44.780 --> 05:46.730
So now we have that foot.

05:46.740 --> 05:54.930
I k bone selected and if we hit G can move it around you can see just like shaking your hand we can

05:54.930 --> 06:05.790
grab that one part of the chain and the hip and the knee bone then adjust to compensate to where you

06:05.790 --> 06:07.940
put that target bone you see.

06:07.980 --> 06:10.710
So that is our AK chain.

06:10.730 --> 06:17.690
But the problem is look at the foot bone as I move it the foot bone and the foot.

06:17.700 --> 06:22.400
I k bone become separated and we don't want that.

06:22.410 --> 06:27.170
So let me just hit the right mouse button to get out of that.

06:27.210 --> 06:34.120
Now we need to add a constraint to make sure the foot I K in the foot bone stay together.

06:34.140 --> 06:43.530
So what let's do is take that original foot bone again right here foot dot L and we'll add a copy rotation

06:43.540 --> 06:48.100
constraints so it matches the rotation of the I K bone.

06:48.180 --> 06:56.550
Let's come over here to the bone constraint panel and we'll click here to add a bone constraint copy

06:56.670 --> 06:57.750
rotation.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.950
There we go.

06:58.950 --> 07:00.750
Now for this one we want.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.710
Once again the target to be the armature.

07:03.930 --> 07:07.170
We want the bone to be the foot.

07:07.180 --> 07:13.090
I k again now if we come back and select that foot i k bone.

07:13.170 --> 07:14.300
There we go.

07:14.310 --> 07:22.920
Notice here we've got foot I k now if we hit G and move that around you can see that original foot bone

07:23.340 --> 07:29.020
matches the rotation of the eye K bone and they stay together.

07:29.020 --> 07:37.130
So let me come up here and choose the root bone and if we hit G we can see that foot stays planted there.

07:37.300 --> 07:41.720
When we move the hips around like that.

07:41.770 --> 07:43.240
All right.

07:43.240 --> 07:47.320
So that is how we set up our inverse Cana Maddox chain.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.860
Let's do that quickly again for the other side.

07:50.980 --> 08:01.320
Remember we need to begin in edit mode so let's select that foot dot ah it shift D and enter.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.320
Now let's change this to foot.

08:04.360 --> 08:12.400
I K Dot R and then we'll clear the parent out P clear parent.

08:12.470 --> 08:22.830
Now we go back to pose mode select that original foot bone right here and we'll add in an inverse can

08:22.860 --> 08:32.350
Maddox constraint right there our target will be the armature bone will be the K foot okay.

08:32.360 --> 08:38.450
Dot are chain link to uncheck use.

08:38.470 --> 08:39.970
Tail.

08:40.060 --> 08:42.470
Now we constrain the foot bone to the eye.

08:42.470 --> 08:46.750
K bone by selecting that foot.

08:46.950 --> 08:57.390
Ah we have it selected here still adding a copy rotation target armature and bone.

08:57.410 --> 09:01.170
IK There we go.

09:01.200 --> 09:10.690
So now if we choose that I K bone right there and hit G We get the same kind of functionality.

09:10.810 --> 09:11.830
There we go.

09:11.830 --> 09:16.630
So once again we can select that root bone and hit G.

09:16.630 --> 09:20.650
And we can have him do the squats.

09:20.650 --> 09:21.060
All right.

09:22.380 --> 09:28.650
So now that we've setup the inverse can a man in the next video we'll begin working on setting up the

09:28.650 --> 09:29.520
foot roll rig.
