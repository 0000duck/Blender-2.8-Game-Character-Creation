WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:03.320
Well ultimately I'm going to want to animate this guy.

00:03.330 --> 00:10.540
So we're going to need to create the underlying skeleton or armature that we'll use to animate him.

00:10.560 --> 00:15.330
But first of all I need to figure out how big this character should be.

00:15.330 --> 00:23.100
So should he be real life size like six feet tall or a metre and a half or more or should he be the

00:23.100 --> 00:26.750
actual size of a tiny little Lego piece.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.780
I don't really know.

00:27.780 --> 00:28.730
That's the problem.

00:28.980 --> 00:35.280
But I think what I'm going to do is just kind of make a compromise and just say he's going to be one

00:35.280 --> 00:42.560
metre tall not quite as big as a normal human being but certainly not as small as one of the toys.

00:42.570 --> 00:45.620
So what I'm going to do is create a reference object.

00:45.630 --> 00:50.770
I am just going to press shift a and I'm going to create a cube mesh cube here.

00:50.970 --> 00:58.530
And if I hit the in key you can see over here in the sidebar that the dimensions of this cube is two

00:58.530 --> 01:00.340
meters by two meters.

01:00.390 --> 01:09.570
What I think I'll do is maybe change the z axis to one meter and then change the x and the Y to maybe

01:09.570 --> 01:12.120
point two try that.

01:12.150 --> 01:17.070
So maybe this is how big my characters should be.

01:17.070 --> 01:22.740
If I hit the three key and go to the side view maybe I can bring this up and kind of put it right on

01:22.740 --> 01:28.410
the grid and just generally speaking this is how big my character should be.

01:28.410 --> 01:30.570
So as we can see he's a little too big.

01:30.570 --> 01:37.230
So I'll go to wireframe and I'll just hit the B key and border select.

01:37.230 --> 01:44.080
This whole thing here I'll go ahead and change to global transformation as well.

01:44.310 --> 01:52.980
And now I'd like to scale it down at this point here at the grid and our origin point is is up here

01:52.980 --> 01:57.490
we should probably move that Origin down to the center of the grid as well.

01:57.570 --> 02:05.760
So let's go ahead and come over here to object set Origin and Origin to 3d cursor and that'll move that

02:05.760 --> 02:07.520
down to there.

02:07.530 --> 02:10.250
Now we can just hit s and scale it down.

02:10.260 --> 02:16.920
So let me go to the front view and I'll hit s and scale it down so.

02:17.170 --> 02:19.530
So maybe he's about this big.

02:19.530 --> 02:21.690
Let's see how this works will hit the period.

02:21.690 --> 02:24.300
Key So yeah let's.

02:24.610 --> 02:26.030
Let's see how this works.

02:26.030 --> 02:29.060
I'll hit the Z key and go back to look Dev.

02:29.080 --> 02:29.510
Here

02:32.140 --> 02:35.350
and that probably is pretty good.

02:35.350 --> 02:37.450
I think that's what we'll go with.

02:37.930 --> 02:44.740
So with the character selected here you can see he's about one point O five meters tall and that's fine

02:44.740 --> 02:48.530
that 0 5 there is is tall hair.

02:48.650 --> 02:51.250
Oh I think that'll be fine.

02:51.250 --> 02:59.020
I'll select that cube and hit the delete key and I'll hit in too close that panel.

02:59.470 --> 03:07.630
Now oh actually let me open that panel up again and let's select the character and we need to deal with

03:07.630 --> 03:13.420
our scale our rotation and location are all zeros and that's good.

03:13.420 --> 03:20.650
But the scale here we should take back to 1 so I'll press control a and if you want you can just apply

03:20.680 --> 03:24.090
all transforms here at this point in time that's fine.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.150
So there we go.

03:25.150 --> 03:27.830
We're all back to zeros and ones.

03:27.850 --> 03:35.800
OK now to actually create the armature for the character let's go to the front view and let's press

03:35.860 --> 03:40.920
shift a again and come down here and choose armature.

03:40.990 --> 03:44.750
And when we do that it creates a single bone.

03:44.860 --> 03:49.610
And from this one bone we're going to create the entire armature.

03:49.840 --> 03:56.110
Now as it is currently if we hit the inky we can see we've got zeros and ones in the rotation and scale

03:56.110 --> 03:56.920
and that's good.

03:57.070 --> 04:01.900
We want to keep it that way to change the size and move it.

04:01.900 --> 04:07.440
We should tab into edit mode so I'll hit tab to go into edit mode.

04:07.450 --> 04:14.890
I'll hit Z to go to wireframe and I just want to select this tip of the bone right here and I'll grab

04:14.890 --> 04:21.850
my move tool and I just want to move it straight down in the z axis till it's quite a bit smaller about

04:21.850 --> 04:29.740
like that and then I'm going to select the entire bone by clicking here and bringing it back up in the

04:29.740 --> 04:30.460
z axis.

04:30.460 --> 04:37.060
So it's about like this and I want the tip of this bone to be just at the top of the hips something

04:37.060 --> 04:40.620
like this like that.

04:40.630 --> 04:47.810
All right let's go back to our solid view and we can't see it inside the character the way it is now.

04:47.860 --> 04:57.010
So let's come over here to our object data panel viewport display and let's click on in front right

04:57.010 --> 04:57.280
there.

04:57.280 --> 05:05.050
So now we can see it inside the character even when we go to object mode we can still see it there and

05:05.050 --> 05:12.700
notice that since I moved this in edit mode the actual origin of the object is still remaining here

05:12.700 --> 05:13.630
in the center of the grid.

05:13.630 --> 05:15.060
And that's good.

05:15.070 --> 05:15.310
All right.

05:15.340 --> 05:23.110
So with this selected maybe I'll go to the side view with the three key and let's select this top tip

05:23.170 --> 05:28.660
of the bone right there and let's hit e to extrude it.

05:28.910 --> 05:37.550
So we'll hit E and then I'll hit Z and drag straight up to about oh midpoint on the torso there and

05:37.550 --> 05:47.930
then I'll hit e and Zee and drag straight up to the base of the neck and then E and Z here's the neck

05:49.030 --> 05:55.090
and Ian Z and here's the bone for the head there we go.

05:55.090 --> 06:01.000
So now we have the hip the torso the neck and the head.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.590
Now we need to rename these.

06:02.620 --> 06:08.220
Let's select this bone and let's come over to the bone panel right here.

06:08.230 --> 06:10.630
And here we can see the name of the bones.

06:10.630 --> 06:17.080
So you've got bone bone one two three et cetera.

06:17.110 --> 06:24.820
So let's just grab this one here and let's call this the root bone and we go.

06:24.820 --> 06:30.250
And then the next one let's just call this spine.

06:30.460 --> 06:34.690
One and this one we're gonna call spine to

06:37.830 --> 06:48.570
this one we can call neck and the one up here we'll call head and we go.

06:48.770 --> 06:49.000
All right.

06:49.010 --> 06:52.910
Well that's a good beginning but there's a problem here I think.

06:52.910 --> 06:56.720
And I think we're going to need to address this pretty quick.

06:56.720 --> 07:02.420
Let's tap back into object mode and I'll select the character and let me go to the front view and if

07:02.420 --> 07:10.440
I tap into edit mode where we can see all the edges I've got a joint here but no edge.

07:10.490 --> 07:16.850
Remember I said how at every joint or every bend you should probably have three edges the edge that

07:16.850 --> 07:22.040
it bends on and then edges on either side of that to maintain the shape.

07:22.550 --> 07:24.500
Well here we don't have anything.

07:24.710 --> 07:29.870
And that's going to be a problem if we ever try and bend the torso at this point.

07:29.870 --> 07:36.710
So let's press control are and I'm going to insert an edge loop right here at that joint and then I'm

07:36.710 --> 07:46.050
going to put edge loops on either side here and here and that will allow us to bend the character at

07:46.050 --> 07:51.180
that point at that joint All right so that's going to help there.

07:51.370 --> 07:57.880
The next thing we ought to do is now that I'm thinking about it we should do that on the legs as well

07:57.880 --> 07:58.790
too.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.820
So let's go ahead and do that.

08:00.820 --> 08:01.530
Let's.

08:02.020 --> 08:10.020
Let's hit the three key here and let's create some edges here for a bend at the knee.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.870
We're not going to have the character bend the knees a whole lot but I think it'd be helpful just to

08:13.870 --> 08:16.390
have it be able to bend just a bit.

08:16.390 --> 08:25.210
So let's press control ah and click here and remember we can flip between the two edges here so if I

08:25.210 --> 08:28.710
hit the E key we've got this edge.

08:28.750 --> 08:35.680
And if I hit the f key we can flip back and forth between the edge down here and the shape of the edge

08:35.740 --> 08:36.490
up at the top.

08:36.490 --> 08:40.350
So I just want it right here OK.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.550
So let's also do that on the other side.

08:42.560 --> 08:52.110
I'll press control are click and I'll hit e and hit the f key and we go so that flattens it out.

08:52.110 --> 08:55.940
I just wanted about the same place as the other one right there.

08:56.180 --> 08:56.440
Yeah.

08:57.180 --> 09:05.550
OK so now let's create an edge down here and an edge up here.

09:05.570 --> 09:10.240
Once again I'll hit E and then F and then we go.

09:10.270 --> 09:13.080
So we need to do the same thing down here.

09:13.090 --> 09:17.030
I'll hit control are here.

09:17.260 --> 09:22.760
Control R and click E and F and that should go there.

09:22.760 --> 09:29.140
So now what let's do is press control three to go to the left or the graphic view.

09:29.330 --> 09:36.500
And if I press all Z I get this kind of transparent view I'll hit G two times and that will take me

09:36.500 --> 09:44.610
into slide mode and I'll just slide that edge right there and then let's all click this one control

09:44.610 --> 09:50.310
three and let's hit G twice and I'll slide that edge to there.

09:50.310 --> 09:55.430
So it's about the same place as the other side alt Z.

09:55.860 --> 09:57.190
And then we go.

09:57.270 --> 10:05.430
Now let's tab back into object mode and for the next video we're going to begin adding the bones for

10:05.430 --> 10:06.630
the legs and the arms.
