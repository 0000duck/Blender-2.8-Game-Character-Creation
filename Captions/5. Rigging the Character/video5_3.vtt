WEBVTT

00:00.810 --> 00:07.560
Before we mirror this over we should probably take a look at the rotation and the role of these bones

00:07.680 --> 00:09.450
and make sure it's what we want.

00:09.450 --> 00:16.830
So if we tap into edit mode let's select this upper arm bone here and let's come up here to global and

00:16.830 --> 00:20.400
go to normal transform orientation.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.430
And then I'm going to choose the rotate tool.

00:23.430 --> 00:31.340
Okay so now if we hit the end key and come over here to our sidebar we have this role field here.

00:31.620 --> 00:36.140
What we can do is change the role of the bone to place it or arrange it.

00:36.150 --> 00:38.100
So it's the way we want.

00:38.100 --> 00:47.430
So what I usually try and do with this is have the x axis here be the main angle of rotation so what

00:47.430 --> 00:50.280
way is this bone going to mainly turn.

00:50.280 --> 00:56.820
I would say it's going to mainly turn forward and back maybe as he's running or walking.

00:56.880 --> 01:00.090
I don't think the main angle will be up and down.

01:00.090 --> 01:07.440
So I think forward and back is fine for this you can see the x axis is in a position where this would

01:07.440 --> 01:16.960
go forward and back along the x axis let's look at this one here now I think the main angle of rotation

01:16.960 --> 01:20.110
would be for it to bend up at the elbow right.

01:20.350 --> 01:25.880
But currently the z axis is aligned to that particular axis of rotation.

01:25.930 --> 01:32.950
So what I think I'd like to do is maybe go to the front view here and I want to turn this so the x axis

01:33.040 --> 01:35.830
is pointing toward me instead of the Z axis.

01:35.980 --> 01:44.580
So I can come over here to the role field and I can turn this so that x axis is pointing toward me.

01:44.610 --> 01:52.600
All right let's come over here and look at this one here now for this the x axis is going up and down

01:52.600 --> 02:00.130
for the rest and I think that's probably what we want that main axis would be the wrist bending up and

02:00.130 --> 02:01.150
down.

02:01.150 --> 02:08.290
It would also go side to side but I don't think that would be the main axis so let's now take a look

02:08.290 --> 02:10.720
at this bone.

02:10.720 --> 02:18.400
I think we need to turn this if we kind of angle our view so we're looking at this from the top like

02:18.400 --> 02:19.420
this.

02:19.420 --> 02:22.170
I think what I'd like to do is turn that x axis.

02:22.180 --> 02:33.690
So it points up like that let's also take this one and move it like this and this one and let's move

02:33.690 --> 02:36.120
it like this.

02:36.140 --> 02:36.530
There we go.

02:36.530 --> 02:38.060
Let's give this a try.

02:38.060 --> 02:40.520
I'll also do this on the bottom

02:43.570 --> 02:44.990
and we go like this

02:49.160 --> 02:53.350
and here and here.

02:53.420 --> 02:56.360
Now what we can do is actually test this.

02:56.360 --> 03:00.800
We can go into pose mode and see which way these are turning.

03:00.800 --> 03:06.100
So if I come over here to edit dropdown and choose poser mode.

03:06.200 --> 03:10.000
Now this is the mode that the character will actually be animating in.

03:10.610 --> 03:20.190
So if I take say this bone go to the rotate tool and let's just see if we click on the x axis.

03:20.420 --> 03:23.060
It is rotating mainly in the x axis.

03:23.060 --> 03:33.550
There let me look at this one and this one over what I'm seeing is they're all moving in the negative

03:33.610 --> 03:34.220
x.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.620
Let me try this one here.

03:35.620 --> 03:41.470
This one's moving in the positive x and this one's positive.

03:41.480 --> 03:44.640
So I think this is OK yeah.

03:44.680 --> 03:45.760
Let's go with this.

03:45.760 --> 03:54.460
I mean you look at this one it's turning up and down so up is in the positive down as in the negative.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.410
That should be okay.

03:56.470 --> 04:00.990
This one is going to turn this way that's good.

04:01.190 --> 04:05.460
And this one is going to turn this way.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.290
Good.

04:06.290 --> 04:06.680
Okay.

04:06.710 --> 04:08.980
I think that's gonna work.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.650
Let's go back to edit mode now and let's select this bone down here and let's take a look at this.

04:15.660 --> 04:24.840
Now the x axis is pointing to the side here but these look like they're okay so let's change this one

04:24.840 --> 04:31.410
I'm going to go to the front view here and let's click and drag on the roll and let's change this one

04:31.410 --> 04:33.880
here like this.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.230
There we go.

04:35.230 --> 04:39.810
Now if we go back to post mode we can turn these.

04:39.810 --> 04:42.190
Let's take this yeah.

04:42.220 --> 04:44.800
That's going positive and negative.

04:44.800 --> 04:45.520
That's good.

04:48.650 --> 04:49.190
Negative.

04:49.190 --> 04:49.850
Positive.

04:49.850 --> 04:50.150
Yeah.

04:50.150 --> 04:52.430
I think these are gonna work.

04:52.430 --> 05:00.670
Everything's moving in the x axis just fine and once again I'm in the normal transformation orientation

05:00.670 --> 05:02.410
here as I do this.

05:02.650 --> 05:02.970
All right.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.820
So let's go back to edit mode now and the next thing we should do is mirror these over.

05:08.820 --> 05:14.520
Now before I do that I'd like to see all the names here in the viewport of the bones.

05:14.530 --> 05:22.660
And to do that we can come over here to the Object data panel and we can click on names and there we

05:22.660 --> 05:26.570
go we can see the names in our viewport.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.270
Now let me hit the Z key.

05:28.270 --> 05:30.390
Here you can see him better here.

05:30.430 --> 05:37.380
So we have all the names in place for the left side of the rig and the center torso.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.490
We need to mirror these over now.

05:39.490 --> 05:42.700
So let's begin with the legs down here.

05:42.730 --> 05:49.330
Let's move the cursor into the center of the grid with shift s cursor to world origin.

05:49.330 --> 05:53.540
And then I'm gonna go through and select all of these bones.

05:53.550 --> 06:03.180
Here and I want to make sure that I'm using the 3d cursor as my pivot point here you can see that there

06:03.720 --> 06:07.400
may change back to Global transforms.

06:07.440 --> 06:12.290
Now what this do is duplicate this chain and then mirror it in the x axis.

06:12.300 --> 06:18.880
And when we do it should mirror around this point here around our our pivot point our 3d cursor.

06:18.990 --> 06:28.290
So I'll press shift D and enter and then I'll press control M control M and then I'll hit the X key

06:28.290 --> 06:34.920
to mirror in the x axis and then I'll hit enter and there we go.

06:34.920 --> 06:39.530
So now we have our chain over here but we need to deal with our names.

06:39.780 --> 06:47.910
Well we can do is right click on the chain there and then go to names and we can choose flip names and

06:47.910 --> 06:54.960
when we do that you can see we've got up leg dot our low leg dot are et cetera.

06:54.990 --> 06:58.110
However this 0 0 1 is still there.

06:58.110 --> 07:05.820
And that really shouldn't be I think this is a beta version issue that they haven't fixed yet in version

07:05.820 --> 07:11.940
two point seven nine and earlier when you flipped the names it would change the L to R and then it would

07:11.940 --> 07:13.980
also remove the 0 0 1.

07:13.980 --> 07:19.860
So I think they still need to work on that but we can always come over here and do it the old fashioned

07:19.860 --> 07:27.070
way manually select each one of these and remove that dot 0 0 1 out of the name.

07:27.150 --> 07:31.040
That's not a problem we can do that there.

07:31.050 --> 07:39.700
And this one here so I would imagine in a future version that will be cleaned up.

07:39.700 --> 07:43.690
All right let's try that again with the arm and the hand.

07:43.960 --> 07:52.230
So I'll just select all of these bones here like that and then let's do the same thing.

07:52.240 --> 07:59.230
Let's press shift D and enter and then analysts press control M and the X key and that will mirror those

07:59.230 --> 08:07.740
over to the other side and then I'll hit enter and then right click names flip names and then we got

08:07.740 --> 08:16.700
to go through and take away the 0 0 1 for each one of these so I will do that before the next video.

08:16.960 --> 08:24.760
And at that time will parent the arms and the legs to the main torso here and then we'll try and bind

08:24.790 --> 08:26.830
the character mesh to the armature.
