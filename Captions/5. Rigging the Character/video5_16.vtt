00:00.710 --> 00:01.000
All right.

00:01.010 --> 00:06.500
Let's begin with the actual foot control bone this main foot control.

00:06.610 --> 00:13.140
I'll select that and let's use a circle for this a select circle.

00:13.310 --> 00:22.550
And remember we want to use that foot control SEO dot L right here and that spins it around like that

00:23.120 --> 00:24.620
and that's kind of nice.

00:24.620 --> 00:28.250
We could probably reduce the size just a little bit.

00:28.250 --> 00:28.730
Let me try.

00:28.730 --> 00:30.820
Point nine here.

00:30.830 --> 00:34.320
Just so it sticks out a little bit there.

00:35.030 --> 00:39.230
Like that but isn't going over the center of the grid.

00:39.250 --> 00:39.760
Let me try.

00:39.760 --> 00:40.840
Point nine five.

00:41.920 --> 00:42.320
Yeah.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.350
I think that worked pretty well.

00:44.470 --> 00:44.860
All right.

00:44.860 --> 00:48.130
So now let's take this bone here and hide it away

00:51.300 --> 00:53.520
onto layer two.

00:53.550 --> 00:55.900
Now let's work on this one here.

00:55.980 --> 01:01.940
This bone and this bone and the need I think I may use a sphere for all of those.

01:01.980 --> 01:05.640
So let's select that foot roll bone.

01:05.760 --> 01:15.170
Let's choose a sphere and let's also then bind that foot roll control object here on the left.

01:15.270 --> 01:15.570
Nope.

01:15.570 --> 01:20.740
That's the foot control I need the foot roll and that.

01:20.820 --> 01:21.480
Here it is.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.460
Foot roll underscore CEO dot l.

01:24.630 --> 01:32.670
Let's move that they're and let's scale this down on click and drag and let's see that's not bad let's

01:32.670 --> 01:41.540
go with Point two there and let's take this bone then and move it away to the other layer.

01:41.730 --> 01:52.230
Okay there we have that let's work on the toe let's select the toe bone let's choose a sphere for this

01:53.160 --> 01:58.660
let's find that toe bone or that toe control object.

01:58.660 --> 02:02.080
Here it is toe control object dot l.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.340
Here it is and let's shrink this down quite a bit.

02:05.990 --> 02:13.850
Let's go with point three on that and once again your scale numbers will probably be different sense

02:13.850 --> 02:18.470
the size of your control object bones will probably be a little different.

02:18.470 --> 02:26.910
All right so let's now select the knee and this as well we're gonna want a sphere and we want a knee

02:28.460 --> 02:39.200
control object need control object dot l we go and we'll shrink this down like that I'll put that at

02:39.200 --> 02:49.860
point three Okay so let's select this bone and this bone move those two layer to right there so we don't

02:49.860 --> 02:54.450
see them and then let's come over and do the same thing over here.

02:54.710 --> 03:03.760
So this foot control bone right here we're gonna want a circle and we want it to match the transform

03:03.820 --> 03:13.440
of that foot control here it is but control object dot Ah there we go and what I do.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.530
Point nine five I think so.

03:16.650 --> 03:27.210
Yep there we go And now let's take this bone and hide it away in Layer two we go and this bone here

03:27.270 --> 03:37.930
we want a sphere and we want that to be at the same location as that but roll control objects.

03:37.950 --> 03:41.980
So right here and what did we do.

03:41.980 --> 03:53.990
Point two over here so it's like that point to where we go now let's do the toe that'll be a sphere

03:53.990 --> 04:00.030
as well we want to control object are

04:03.020 --> 04:07.530
right here and I recall it was point three.

04:07.580 --> 04:12.690
That looks about right now the NE sphere

04:15.290 --> 04:17.270
ne control object

04:19.930 --> 04:21.510
ne control object.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.600
Ah there we go.

04:23.740 --> 04:28.820
And what's this point three as well yep it looks like it.

04:28.830 --> 04:39.390
Okay so now we take this bone this bone and this bone and hide them away in Layer two and then we go.

04:39.390 --> 04:42.090
So now we've got all of those.

04:42.090 --> 04:46.240
Now we just really need to take these bones and hide them away as well.

04:46.260 --> 04:55.620
So if we take this and this and this and this and this hide these away layer to well there is one

04:59.080 --> 05:10.430
guy and then these know me go in and get these like this and we'll probably have that one more we've

05:10.430 --> 05:11.150
got to deal with.

05:11.620 --> 05:12.550
Yeah there it is

05:16.760 --> 05:17.920
and there we go.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.130
OK.

05:19.330 --> 05:25.030
So now we have all of our bones over here.

05:25.030 --> 05:31.840
All of those control object bones et cetera and our control objects over here.

05:31.850 --> 05:39.530
So now we can just select our control objects and move the character around and this is how we'll animate

05:39.530 --> 05:39.710
them.

05:39.740 --> 05:45.320
So we can select this let's say and hit R and roll it up on the toe and back on the heel.

05:45.320 --> 05:45.670
All right.

05:45.680 --> 05:50.360
We can select this foot control object and move it around.

05:50.900 --> 05:58.370
So this is how we'll actually animate the character but in doing so it might be helpful to kind of color

05:58.370 --> 06:04.880
code these control objects so we can see very easily which ones are on the right side which ones are

06:04.880 --> 06:08.240
on the left side and which ones are in the center.

06:08.330 --> 06:09.440
So let's work on that.

06:09.470 --> 06:15.230
I think what let's do is come over here to our bone groups panel right here.

06:15.230 --> 06:21.500
And what we can do is select say some of these let's select everything going down the center of the

06:21.500 --> 06:26.060
character the torso the hips the head anything in the center.

06:26.180 --> 06:31.550
And let's create a new group and we'll call this center.

06:31.670 --> 06:38.390
We'll just call this our center bones and we'll click a sign and then we go.

06:38.390 --> 06:44.660
Now what we can do is we can come up here and click on this default color pull down and I think for

06:44.660 --> 06:48.520
the center everything in the center I'm going to make yellow.

06:48.700 --> 06:49.280
And there we go.

06:49.280 --> 06:52.880
So anything in the middle is going to be yellow.

06:52.880 --> 07:00.830
We'll be able to see that very easily as we're animating now everything on the right hand side let's

07:00.830 --> 07:13.490
make all of this red red for the right side let's create a new group here we'll call this right side

07:15.450 --> 07:20.730
click a sign and let's make this red right here.

07:20.730 --> 07:20.990
Yeah.

07:21.000 --> 07:21.860
There we go.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.990
Oh we need to add these down here so let's grab this.

07:24.990 --> 07:29.820
This this and the knee on the right hand side as well.

07:30.120 --> 07:34.890
And let's click a sign and here we go OK.

07:34.900 --> 07:39.130
So now on this other side let's make this other side.

07:39.130 --> 07:43.320
Green or blue whichever you want.

07:43.580 --> 07:45.670
I think I'll make mine green.

07:45.690 --> 07:48.470
I'll call this left side

07:51.300 --> 07:52.480
I'll sign.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.120
And then let's find a nice green.

07:54.130 --> 07:55.480
Here's a nice bright green.

07:55.480 --> 08:07.030
Let's do that and we go and these down here and let's select this and these and let's sign those.

08:07.030 --> 08:08.310
There we go.

08:08.320 --> 08:15.540
So now everything on the right side is red on the left is green down the center is yellow.

08:15.540 --> 08:21.070
So that's just going to help us quickly identify what we need as we're animating.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.050
In addition what I'd like to do is turn off in front here.

08:24.110 --> 08:31.690
You can turn this off so we don't see the back side of the control objects through the character.

08:31.700 --> 08:31.980
All right.

08:31.990 --> 08:38.570
So if we're looking at this side we only see the control objects for the arm on this side.

08:38.620 --> 08:45.880
We don't see the other ones over there that'll just once again make things a little easier to select.

08:45.890 --> 08:46.430
All right.

08:46.430 --> 08:54.870
And then well we could just close that and go over to our look Dev here and there we go there is how

08:54.870 --> 08:57.100
we'll animate our character.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.540
I think we're ready to go.

08:59.640 --> 09:07.770
So in the next section we're going to try and animate this character both the 3D body and a 2D face

09:07.860 --> 09:08.840
at the same time.

09:09.240 --> 09:15.900
But first we need to do a little setup so that we can draw the face on the head and we'll begin that

09:15.900 --> 09:16.680
coming up next.
