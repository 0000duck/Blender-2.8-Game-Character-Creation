00:00.650 --> 00:07.250
Now we're going to parent these bones in such a way that we can control and rotate the foot and achieve

00:07.250 --> 00:10.030
that foot roll functionality.

00:10.070 --> 00:16.970
So first of all let's begin with the left side here and let's come in and choose that foot.

00:16.970 --> 00:23.930
I K Dot l It's choose this here we've got the foot l let me click it again and there we go.

00:23.990 --> 00:31.440
There it is foot Ike dot L and then I'll press shift and click and select this TOE ROLL.

00:31.520 --> 00:37.880
So keep in mind we're still in edit mode here select the foot I K and then the TOE ROLL.

00:37.880 --> 00:46.910
Now we can press control P to parent the foot I K to the TOE ROLL AND THEN CLICK keep offset because

00:46.910 --> 00:54.800
we want to keep these in the same location in the same position as they are now so we click that next

00:54.800 --> 01:01.550
we want to make the heel roll bone apparent of the TOE ROLL so we'll click the toe shift select the

01:01.550 --> 01:06.640
heel and same thing control P and keep offset.

01:06.770 --> 01:11.970
Now we want to make the heel and the foot roll bone.

01:12.020 --> 01:19.610
Children of this foot control so the foot control is basically going to be the parent of all of these.

01:19.610 --> 01:28.460
So let's select the heel shift select the foot roll and then shift click the foot control bone and then

01:28.670 --> 01:32.730
control P and once again keep offset.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.640
Let's take a look at what that did for us.

01:35.650 --> 01:42.550
I'm going to come back over here to post mode now let's select this foot control bone and we better

01:42.550 --> 01:47.880
change our median point back to or our pivot point back to median.

01:48.100 --> 01:55.510
And now if we hit G and move this around you can see that foot control bone moves everything.

01:55.630 --> 02:02.920
In addition it also moves or it also controls the rotation of everything as well so that as I said is

02:02.920 --> 02:05.590
the parent of all of these bones.

02:05.680 --> 02:11.500
In addition we should be able to take this bone here and roll it in the x and you can see how we can

02:11.500 --> 02:19.270
roll it forward on that toe joint there and then I'll press Alt R and then here for this joint we can

02:19.270 --> 02:20.490
roll this back.

02:20.490 --> 02:24.420
Now you can see how it's going to kind of pivot on that heel.

02:24.760 --> 02:29.040
It looks like we're going to need to do a little weight painting back here.

02:29.170 --> 02:32.030
You can see how that heel is coming off the ground there.

02:32.140 --> 02:38.800
But that's why I wanted to wait until we were all done with the foot roll rig before we go in and do

02:38.800 --> 02:40.610
any more weight painting.

02:40.630 --> 02:47.650
All right I'm gonna press Alt are and let's go back to edit mode and do the same thing for the other

02:47.650 --> 02:48.550
side.

02:48.610 --> 02:51.440
So over here Let's select that foot.

02:51.460 --> 03:00.650
I k bone here shift select the toe bone and press control P and keep offset.

03:00.700 --> 03:10.830
Now we select the toe and then the heel control P keep offset and then we do the heel and the foot roll

03:11.890 --> 03:18.290
then the foot control and control P and keep offset.

03:18.310 --> 03:19.840
Now let's go test it out.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.330
So we go back to pose mode.

03:22.780 --> 03:29.680
This bone right here should be able to move everything and rotate everything.

03:29.680 --> 03:36.520
Yeah I'm in the press Alt R and all G and that'll take it back and then this bone here we should be

03:36.520 --> 03:39.340
able to roll forward on that toe bone.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.630
Yeah.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.010
And this one we should be able to roll back at the heel.

03:45.190 --> 03:46.030
Sure enough.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.340
Okay so we're making progress.

03:49.340 --> 03:50.120
That's good.

03:51.290 --> 03:57.710
Now what ultimately needs to happen is this bone here is going to be what controls the roll forward

03:58.100 --> 04:05.270
and back when we roll it up it'll roll onto the toe and when we roll it down it will roll back onto

04:05.270 --> 04:08.980
the heel it are to clear that.

04:09.050 --> 04:12.630
So let's go ahead and work on this to set that up.

04:12.830 --> 04:15.500
To do that we're going to use some constraints.

04:15.500 --> 04:19.930
So I'm gonna come over here to the toe roll first of all let's set this up.

04:20.150 --> 04:26.840
And if we come over here to the bone constraints panel let's add a copy rotation constraint right here

04:27.560 --> 04:34.280
and of course we want the target to be the armature and we want the bone that we're getting the rotation

04:34.280 --> 04:34.790
from.

04:34.790 --> 04:36.350
To be that foot roll here.

04:36.980 --> 04:39.310
So it's like this.

04:39.590 --> 04:41.240
Scroll down a bit.

04:42.230 --> 04:44.850
And here's that foot roll dot l.

04:44.930 --> 04:46.910
So let's select that.

04:46.910 --> 04:54.550
Now you can see it changed just a little bit here what we need to do is come in and change our space

04:54.550 --> 05:04.960
from world to local here and here and also we need to uncheck the z and y axes so let's see what we've

05:04.960 --> 05:05.560
done here.

05:05.560 --> 05:08.290
Let's select that foot roll bone.

05:08.290 --> 05:18.610
Let's turn it up and look at that that turned that bone up as well so we can rotate on the toe.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.550
But now we don't want it to go all the way like this.

05:21.850 --> 05:26.020
We need to kind of limit the rotation so we don't get crazy with it here.

05:26.020 --> 05:35.290
So I mean for us old are and if we select that toe bone again let's add a limit rotation constraint

05:35.290 --> 05:36.050
as well.

05:37.260 --> 05:44.840
Let's limited in the X let's limited by what you think 30 degrees I'm going to try 30.

05:44.880 --> 05:49.950
I think that'll work pretty well and local space.

05:49.950 --> 05:50.250
All right.

05:50.280 --> 05:57.940
So now if I select this bone here and I rotate it even though I keep going it will quit at 30 percent.

05:58.020 --> 06:01.690
The that's what we want.

06:01.710 --> 06:02.440
All right.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.010
All right.

06:03.050 --> 06:08.350
Ah now let's do a similar thing for the heel back here for this one once again.

06:08.350 --> 06:16.030
Let's also add a copy rotation constraint right here our target will be the armature.

06:16.170 --> 06:26.810
Let's turn off Zee and why switch to local space and we'll select that foot roll dot L. bone as well.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.730
Right here we go.

06:31.730 --> 06:38.300
Now for this one we want to activate this to roll up when this bone rolls down.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.350
So we want to invert this.

06:40.370 --> 06:47.060
Just click invert their nav we select this bone and we roll it back like this.

06:47.060 --> 06:49.020
It works pretty well.

06:49.030 --> 06:51.020
That that looks good.

06:51.020 --> 06:58.430
But if we roll it forward it kind of goes all crazy and that's because we need to limit that rotation

06:58.430 --> 07:00.310
the way we did for the toe roll.

07:00.320 --> 07:04.760
So let me press Alt R and let's go back to the heel roll.

07:04.760 --> 07:14.450
Now let's add a limit rotation constraint here and then let's choose limit in the X will also put 30

07:14.450 --> 07:19.700
degrees in here and we'll change this from world space to local.

07:19.700 --> 07:20.830
There we go.

07:20.870 --> 07:21.750
Now let's test it.

07:21.890 --> 07:24.770
Let's go over to the foot roll.

07:24.770 --> 07:25.940
Let's roll this back.

07:26.210 --> 07:26.470
Yeah.

07:26.510 --> 07:27.900
That works pretty well.

07:28.110 --> 07:29.460
And let's roll it forward.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.170
Yep.

07:30.200 --> 07:37.040
The toe turns there the heel turns there and once again the mesh is pulling here because we have to

07:37.040 --> 07:40.430
do a little bit of weight painting here and fix that.

07:40.430 --> 07:41.760
So that's fine.

07:42.090 --> 07:44.530
All are to clear that.

07:44.600 --> 07:44.840
All right.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.340
Let's do that same thing on the other side.

07:47.420 --> 07:58.960
So let's select that toe roll bone let's add a copy rotation constraint turnoff y and z local space

08:00.500 --> 08:07.900
and let's do the armature as the target and the bone as the foot roll.

08:07.980 --> 08:09.720
Are.

08:09.930 --> 08:22.700
Now let's add a limit rotation constraint we'll call it 30 degrees local space and let's give it a test.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.240
We select this.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.780
Roll it forward good.

08:27.800 --> 08:28.340
All right.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.850
That's working pretty well.

08:30.930 --> 08:44.700
Now the heel once again a copy rotation turnoff y and z local space armature is the target foot roll

08:44.730 --> 08:46.710
as the bone right here.

08:46.830 --> 08:54.750
And remember for this one we want to invert it and also let's add that limit rotation constraint.

08:54.750 --> 08:55.890
There we go.

08:56.100 --> 09:00.960
And let's give this 30 degrees and change from world to local.

09:00.960 --> 09:01.250
All right.

09:01.260 --> 09:04.900
So now let's test this when we roll it back.

09:04.920 --> 09:05.540
Good.

09:05.610 --> 09:07.400
We roll it forward.

09:07.410 --> 09:08.280
Good.

09:08.370 --> 09:09.560
That works as well.

09:10.380 --> 09:19.440
OK so in the next video what let's do is work on keeping these toes flat on the ground as we turn up

09:19.440 --> 09:20.820
on that joint.

09:20.820 --> 09:27.090
And also I'd like to add some controls for the knees as well so we can point the knees where we want

09:27.090 --> 09:27.870
them to go.

09:27.870 --> 09:36.450
So if say this foot was turning like this we could then take that knee and point it in the same direction.

09:36.480 --> 09:36.750
All right.

09:36.770 --> 09:37.150
All right.

09:37.160 --> 09:37.980
Ah.

09:38.220 --> 09:39.860
And we'll work on that next.
