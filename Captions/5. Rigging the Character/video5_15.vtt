00:00.420 --> 00:03.000
Now for the hips here let's use a different shape.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.830
Let's select that.

00:04.830 --> 00:07.720
Let's come over here and under our custom object.

00:07.740 --> 00:14.130
Let's choose the box right there now because it has three dimensions it's a solid figure.

00:14.130 --> 00:17.990
Here we can choose wireframe and clean that up.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.930
Now let's come over here and choose our custom shape transform.

00:21.930 --> 00:24.520
And that was root I believe.

00:24.540 --> 00:30.460
Let's scroll down here it is root underscore SEO and that spins that around.

00:30.480 --> 00:37.640
Now it's a little too small I think it needs to be wider and it's not quite in the right place.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.480
So how do we fix that.

00:39.480 --> 00:46.080
Well what we can do is actually go back to that original shape go into edit mode and scale and move

00:46.080 --> 00:46.440
it.

00:46.440 --> 00:51.190
So let's go back to object mode over here.

00:51.240 --> 00:59.910
Let's then open up our control objects and I'll unharmed the collection and then I'll also on hide the

00:59.910 --> 01:01.330
box here.

01:01.350 --> 01:03.050
So here it is.

01:03.060 --> 01:08.400
So keep an eye on the control object as we change the box here.

01:08.470 --> 01:18.290
I'll tab into edit mode and let's do is let's scale out in the X S and X you can see it moving there.

01:18.720 --> 01:26.950
The control object and then let's also raise it up you can see it moving up in there as well.

01:27.900 --> 01:32.160
So maybe about like this.

01:32.270 --> 01:33.790
That's looking pretty good.

01:36.310 --> 01:37.230
I think that'll work.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.310
There may be a little bit farther down.

01:39.310 --> 01:41.870
Let's try this yeah.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.480
I think I like that.

01:43.610 --> 01:48.320
So now that we've got that let's tab back into object mode.

01:48.320 --> 01:57.020
We can hide this away again and then this now is our new control object for the hips.

01:57.020 --> 01:59.490
Let's go back to post mode.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.640
There we go.

02:00.760 --> 02:09.800
And let's now choose this bone here and let's hide this away pose change bone layer layer two and then

02:09.800 --> 02:11.150
it goes.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.190
All right.

02:12.390 --> 02:12.810
That's good.

02:12.810 --> 02:21.510
So if we grab this object and hit the G key you can see we can move everything around and we go OK how

02:21.510 --> 02:22.420
about the arms.

02:22.470 --> 02:23.700
Let's take a look at this.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.920
Let's choose this arm here.

02:26.060 --> 02:29.830
Go grab our Custom Object circle.

02:29.830 --> 02:37.630
And there it is there let's choose our bone which is going to be up arm.

02:37.770 --> 02:43.810
Else so here it is up arm control object Elle.

02:43.840 --> 02:44.350
OK.

02:44.380 --> 02:45.370
And we've got that.

02:45.490 --> 02:48.010
But it's turned the wrong way.

02:48.010 --> 02:50.110
So what do we do with this.

02:50.110 --> 02:57.430
Well just like changing the role of any other bone we can select it go into edit mode at the end key

02:57.460 --> 03:07.050
and click and drag on the roll here and let's just turn it 90 degrees like this let's try that and then

03:07.050 --> 03:09.950
go back to pose mode.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.240
And there it is.

03:11.840 --> 03:12.660
Yeah that's not bad.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.170
Let's let's go with that.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.030
Let's shrink it down a bit.

03:17.810 --> 03:19.900
Something like this.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.460
I'll just type in.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.420
Uh point seven.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.950
Let's go with that.

03:24.950 --> 03:26.190
There we go.

03:26.330 --> 03:28.290
And then let's select this.

03:28.430 --> 03:30.420
Move it to our layer two.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.400
And there we go.

03:31.400 --> 03:36.090
So now if we take this we can move that around.

03:36.090 --> 03:39.780
I'll hit R and like this.

03:39.780 --> 03:40.230
There we go.

03:40.440 --> 03:40.990
OK.

03:41.010 --> 03:42.570
That works.

03:42.570 --> 03:54.940
Let's try this one now let's create a circle control object will call this lower arm low arm underscore

03:54.940 --> 03:56.550
SEO dot l.

03:56.980 --> 04:04.840
This too can be turned a bit Let's select that bone go into edit mode and let's roll this about like

04:04.870 --> 04:12.170
this I'm just gonna turn it about forty five degrees let's try this back pose mode.

04:12.550 --> 04:21.430
Not too bad I think I want to turn it a little bit more let's try like this maybe sixty five let's try

04:21.430 --> 04:24.500
that pose mode.

04:24.510 --> 04:25.160
Here we go.

04:26.000 --> 04:37.110
Select it let's shrink it down a bit maybe let's uh we can maybe go point six on that as well and let's

04:37.110 --> 04:37.820
work on the hand.

04:37.820 --> 04:49.430
Now take this one custom object circle custom shape transform is gonna be the hand hand underscore SEO

04:49.430 --> 04:54.080
dot L and we go and this needs to be turned a bit as well.

04:58.180 --> 05:02.470
Let's turn it like this pose.

05:02.950 --> 05:04.930
Yeah that's pretty good.

05:04.930 --> 05:13.600
Let's select this let's increase the size of this maybe we'll call this one point five yeah that'll

05:13.600 --> 05:14.230
work.

05:16.140 --> 05:24.450
And then let's go ahead and hide this bone and this bone or move them over to that other layer.

05:24.460 --> 05:27.810
All right here we go.

05:27.830 --> 05:32.870
Now if we take this and turn it you can see they all come along.

05:32.990 --> 05:37.220
We can take this one and bend it like this.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.910
All right I'll select everything.

05:39.980 --> 05:46.190
Press alt are an all g to get us back to our original positions.

05:46.260 --> 05:50.690
And this one here I feel like it's maybe a little bit too big I'll take that down to point five.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.020
There we go.

05:52.630 --> 05:55.690
OK now let's work on the fingers.

05:55.880 --> 06:02.660
Let's select this bone here let's give it a sphere.

06:02.660 --> 06:05.330
This time we've used a circle and the box.

06:05.330 --> 06:06.470
Let's use a sphere.

06:06.470 --> 06:12.520
Now let's choose that finger one control object.

06:12.640 --> 06:20.020
El let's do that and let's shrink it down maybe two point two.

06:20.020 --> 06:32.010
Let's try that let's do it again sphere finger to control object El point two.

06:32.060 --> 06:33.870
Yeah that works pretty well.

06:34.020 --> 06:47.250
This one sphere finger 3 CEO El let's take it down to point two as well and then let's select all of

06:47.250 --> 07:00.050
these and move them over to the other layer and we go okay these let's once again use a sphere and this

07:00.050 --> 07:05.930
is gonna be the thumb one isn't it thumb one control object.

07:05.930 --> 07:08.370
There we go point two

07:12.560 --> 07:14.480
sphere.

07:14.590 --> 07:16.010
This will be thumb to

07:18.930 --> 07:30.450
here point to and this one we want to sphere and this will be thumb 3 on the left side.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.720
There we go.

07:31.820 --> 07:39.980
In point two now we take all of these moving to the other layer.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.260
There we go.

07:41.260 --> 07:46.280
All right we're getting there so you can begin to see what we're doing here.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.840
We're cleaning all this up.

07:47.980 --> 07:54.640
So as we animate the control objects we'll be present and visible but not so much in the way we'll be

07:54.640 --> 07:57.610
able to see more of our character than the rig.

07:57.610 --> 08:02.220
All right let's work on this side now doing the same thing.

08:02.350 --> 08:05.260
We're going to choose a circle.

08:05.260 --> 08:09.030
We're going to choose the up arm on the right.

08:09.140 --> 08:17.980
Right here up arms SEO are and we're going to take this guy and we're gonna turn it 90 degrees over

08:17.980 --> 08:23.800
in the role field like this something like that.

08:23.860 --> 08:26.300
Let's go back to pose mode.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.400
There we go that looks pretty good.

08:28.750 --> 08:36.190
And let's shrink this down like about like this will type in point seven.

08:36.190 --> 08:37.840
Let's do that.

08:37.840 --> 08:38.480
All right.

08:38.500 --> 08:42.790
Now let's work on the upper excuse me the lower arm.

08:42.790 --> 08:50.320
We'll make that a circle again lower arm control object on the right.

08:50.580 --> 08:58.600
We'll select that and let's go into edit mode and let's roll this around like this.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.370
Is that enough.

08:59.380 --> 09:00.910
Let's try that.

09:00.910 --> 09:01.290
Oh no.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.060
That's not even close.

09:03.700 --> 09:07.490
Let's roll that this way.

09:07.490 --> 09:15.490
Like that let's try that maybe negative sixty five back to pose mode.

09:15.490 --> 09:15.850
Yeah.

09:15.850 --> 09:17.630
That's a little better.

09:17.710 --> 09:19.940
What we have over here point five OK.

09:19.960 --> 09:32.840
Let's type in point five here here's the hand let's choose the circle again we'll need the hand control

09:32.840 --> 09:47.290
object and control on the right we will turn this quite a bit edit mode let's turn it this way like

09:47.290 --> 09:47.830
that

09:50.900 --> 09:54.540
back to pose mode what did I put it over here.

09:54.550 --> 09:57.070
This hand is one point five.

09:57.070 --> 10:00.220
So let's do the same thing let's try that.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.830
Okay.

10:02.020 --> 10:13.090
Now select all of these and take them over to that other layer right here pose change bone layers we

10:13.090 --> 10:15.360
go all right.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.630
So I'm going to leave this hand to you.

10:17.640 --> 10:23.490
I'm going to go ahead and work on this before the next video and in the next video will come down here

10:23.880 --> 10:29.920
and work on creating the custom objects for the feet the toes in the knees.

10:30.030 --> 10:30.870
So that's coming up.
