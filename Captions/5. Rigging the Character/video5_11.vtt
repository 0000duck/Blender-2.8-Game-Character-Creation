WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:00.900
All right.

00:00.910 --> 00:03.940
Let's now work on cleaning up that toe and heel.

00:04.030 --> 00:10.270
Now that we have the foot roll rig in place first of all I think all the names here are going to get

00:10.330 --> 00:16.750
in the way for me so when I come back over to the Object data panel and let's turn off the names here

00:17.300 --> 00:19.530
and that helps clean it up a bit.

00:19.810 --> 00:23.040
Now what we need to do is fix this toe.

00:23.050 --> 00:29.350
So if I roll the toe forward you can see it kind of tilts down here like that.

00:29.350 --> 00:35.820
And if I roll this back onto the heel you can see how that heel picks up off the ground there.

00:35.830 --> 00:39.850
So we need to clean these up so the toe and the heel stay planted.

00:39.850 --> 00:43.300
When we roll the foot back and forth.

00:43.300 --> 00:49.090
So first of all let's roll it forward like this and let's take a look at what we can do here.

00:49.090 --> 00:55.840
I think what we need to do is maybe take this whole front part of the toe and just assign it completely

00:55.930 --> 00:57.520
to the toe bone.

00:57.560 --> 01:02.590
So let's go over to weight paint mode on a select the character here.

01:02.590 --> 01:05.560
Go over to weight paint.

01:05.560 --> 01:12.040
Let's shift right click and select that toe and yeah you can see it's kind of green here.

01:12.060 --> 01:15.610
It really needs to be more bright red.

01:15.610 --> 01:19.450
So if we tap into edit mode we'll look at what happens.

01:19.480 --> 01:23.490
We go back to the default pose.

01:23.590 --> 01:29.220
So we need to be able to see our character deformed when we're in edit mode.

01:29.650 --> 01:37.260
So that's controlled in that armature modifier panel just like a subdivision surface modifier is.

01:37.270 --> 01:43.750
So we need to go back to object mode and select our character and let's go over here to the modifiers

01:43.750 --> 01:52.690
panel and these two here we will turn on display modifier in edit mode and we'll also show the edit

01:52.690 --> 01:53.110
cage.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.550
So that should help that.

01:55.600 --> 01:59.020
Let's now go back to white paint mode.

01:59.020 --> 02:02.910
Let's select our toe bone and if we tap into edit mode.

02:02.920 --> 02:03.490
There we go.

02:03.490 --> 02:08.530
Now we can see the mesh and edit mode is staying deformed as well.

02:08.530 --> 02:08.790
All right.

02:08.820 --> 02:13.940
So I think all I really want to do is just select these faces here.

02:14.110 --> 02:19.750
Go over to our vertex groups and with the toe dot l vertex group selected.

02:19.780 --> 02:25.240
I'm just going to click a sign at 100 percent and that pulled it back a bit.

02:25.420 --> 02:26.980
That's not bad.

02:26.980 --> 02:27.300
Yes.

02:27.330 --> 02:29.620
So that helps some there.

02:29.770 --> 02:30.220
All right.

02:30.220 --> 02:32.080
So what about this one here.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.350
Let's choose the foot.

02:34.430 --> 02:40.080
El here and that's got quite a bit of influence up here on the toe.

02:40.080 --> 02:42.810
I think that may be causing our problem.

02:42.810 --> 02:47.040
Let's go back to edit mode and with this still selected.

02:47.040 --> 02:52.530
Let's remove all of this from the foot dot l vertex group click remove.

02:52.770 --> 02:54.690
Oh yeah that helped quite a bit.

02:54.690 --> 02:56.290
Well that's good.

02:56.420 --> 02:57.390
All right.

02:57.470 --> 03:02.520
So now the heel I think for the heel.

03:02.600 --> 03:06.350
What we need to do is maybe come back up here let's uh.

03:06.500 --> 03:12.680
Well first let's take a look at the total press shift right click and choose toe and is there any influence

03:12.680 --> 03:15.290
happening down here from the toe.

03:15.290 --> 03:18.160
Well it's possible it's kind of hard to tell.

03:18.170 --> 03:24.830
I'll go ahead and tab into edit mode and I'll select this edge and I'll remove that from the toe bone

03:25.960 --> 03:26.220
Yeah.

03:26.230 --> 03:29.290
That moved it a bit back.

03:29.290 --> 03:33.370
Maybe we could go ahead and move remove a couple of these.

03:33.370 --> 03:42.920
Yeah they are moving a bit as we click remove although I think we need those with the toe.

03:42.930 --> 03:47.780
So maybe I shouldn't be so hasty I'll just remove the heel.

03:47.820 --> 03:56.880
Let's do that then let's go back to weight paint mode and let's shift right click the lower leg here

03:57.560 --> 04:02.970
and yeah we've got quite a bit of influence happening here so let's tap into Adam mode and let's go

04:02.970 --> 04:10.260
ahead and do that same thing with this edge here and we'll remove it from the lower leg vertex group.

04:10.440 --> 04:10.840
Oh yeah.

04:10.860 --> 04:11.400
Look at that.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.830
That's quite a bit of influence.

04:12.860 --> 04:15.040
So let's remove all of these.

04:15.180 --> 04:24.640
I think all of these down here at the bottom of the foot should be removed from that lower leg bones.

04:24.650 --> 04:30.370
So let's get all of these there and even maybe this one.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.240
Does this have any.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.960
Let's see remove.

04:34.960 --> 04:35.260
Oh yeah.

04:35.260 --> 04:38.090
There was just a little bit there you could see it move.

04:38.130 --> 04:38.480
OK.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.890
So we've removed all of that.

04:40.900 --> 04:42.230
That's good.

04:42.250 --> 04:45.730
Let's go back to pose mode and see what we can see.

04:45.730 --> 04:49.330
So I'll go back to object mode here for the character.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.270
Select a bone.

04:52.270 --> 04:59.960
Let's go to the rotate tool and now let's try and rotate this up and back and that heel.

04:59.980 --> 05:00.520
Yeah.

05:00.700 --> 05:06.130
So you see what I mean there that heel stays planted and that toe stays planted.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.050
That's what we want.

05:07.070 --> 05:15.370
Now there's this kind of very kind of a sharp angle here but you know what.

05:15.370 --> 05:16.710
He's a blocky character.

05:16.720 --> 05:17.830
I'm not sure I care.

05:17.840 --> 05:21.910
I I I think that's OK you know.

05:21.910 --> 05:23.890
Yeah I think I'm OK with that.

05:23.890 --> 05:24.160
All right.

05:24.190 --> 05:24.970
So there we go.

05:24.970 --> 05:26.380
That's what we needed to do.

05:26.380 --> 05:34.580
We needed to remove some from the heel and the toe and even add a little bit on the toe as well.

05:34.610 --> 05:36.470
OK so I'm gonna pass out.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.160
Ah let's go do that on the other one.

05:39.220 --> 05:40.760
I'll select this.

05:40.810 --> 05:42.580
Roll it forward.

05:42.580 --> 05:43.970
There we go.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.630
And let's uh basically do the same thing.

05:46.630 --> 05:54.580
So if I select the character now and we go back to weight paint mode I will shift right click and choose

05:54.580 --> 05:56.260
that toe bone.

05:56.380 --> 05:56.680
All right.

05:56.710 --> 06:00.810
So what we did is we selected this face here.

06:00.890 --> 06:01.820
Right.

06:01.990 --> 06:11.360
And we added or we assigned at 100 percent these points for the toe vertex group a sign there.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.710
Okay.

06:12.850 --> 06:15.120
And then what did we do.

06:15.190 --> 06:20.240
We removed these from the foot vertex group.

06:20.250 --> 06:20.910
Now didn't we.

06:20.910 --> 06:22.470
So let's click remove.

06:23.070 --> 06:23.380
Oh yeah.

06:23.390 --> 06:23.860
There it is.

06:23.890 --> 06:24.230
Okay.

06:24.240 --> 06:33.080
That's good now I think we also removed the influence for the toe back here.

06:33.090 --> 06:36.370
So let's select that toe and hit remove.

06:36.390 --> 06:39.700
Yeah we did that.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.680
Oh the lower leg.

06:41.680 --> 06:47.530
So let's tab it back into white paint mode shift right click.

06:47.530 --> 06:49.450
Lower leg.

06:49.450 --> 06:54.310
And now let's remove the influence from all of this on the bottom.

06:54.310 --> 06:55.450
So let's.

06:55.840 --> 07:03.470
I'm going to hit the three key to go to base mode and I'll just hit the C key and then I can just click

07:03.470 --> 07:07.130
and drag and paint the selection here.

07:07.130 --> 07:16.720
So for all of this we need to remove this from the lower leg vertex group remove okay.

07:16.790 --> 07:18.750
I think that's what we did.

07:18.750 --> 07:19.080
All right.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.880
Let's take a look.

07:20.900 --> 07:28.490
So if we go back to object mode select this the rotate tool now let's see what happens here.

07:28.490 --> 07:32.890
Let's rotate it back and forward.

07:32.930 --> 07:39.170
Yeah I think that toe and that heals it stays pretty well planted.

07:39.170 --> 07:39.500
Now

07:42.280 --> 07:43.820
yeah okay.

07:44.230 --> 07:47.070
So I think that's what we needed to do.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.080
Let's.

07:48.490 --> 07:56.200
I'm just gonna select everything and press Alt are G just to make sure we get back to the default pose

07:57.610 --> 07:58.690
and there we go.

07:58.690 --> 08:03.850
So let's go ahead and press control s and save we can hit the Look Dev.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.870
And here we are.

08:05.920 --> 08:12.430
So now in the next video let's begin working on creating those control objects the objects that will

08:12.430 --> 08:16.720
actually be using to select and animate the character.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.010
So that's coming up next.
