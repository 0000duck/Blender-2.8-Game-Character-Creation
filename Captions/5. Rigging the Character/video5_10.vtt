WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:06.680
As I mentioned the next trick will be to get this toe bone to stay parallel to the ground.

00:06.780 --> 00:13.270
When we turn the foot up so we're going to need to add a constraint to this as well.

00:13.380 --> 00:17.300
We press Alt are and let's select the toe bone here.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.100
Let's come up and choose.

00:19.290 --> 00:26.850
Add bone constraint and we'll add a copy rotation constraint once again we'll choose the armature as

00:27.030 --> 00:31.710
the target and for the bone here we're gonna want to choose the TOE ROLL.

00:31.710 --> 00:37.200
So I'm just going to type in toe and we'll choose TOE ROLL dot l.

00:37.260 --> 00:38.750
And it goes crazy.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.140
Take a look at that.

00:40.640 --> 00:49.740
What we need to do is change from world to local space for both of these and also we want to turn off

00:49.830 --> 00:50.900
the NY.

00:51.870 --> 00:59.760
And then instead of choosing invert we actually want to select offset so let's select this.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.990
Now let's give it a try.

01:01.500 --> 01:06.300
I'll select this foot roll BONE AND LET'S TURN IT FORWARD AND THERE WE GO.

01:06.300 --> 01:12.370
WE'VE GOT THE TOE staying on the ground when we roll it forward.

01:12.370 --> 01:16.170
So there we go that's that's really the kind of thing that we want.

01:16.540 --> 01:26.530
We want to be able to roll forward and plant that toe and we want to be able to roll back up onto the

01:26.530 --> 01:27.010
heel.

01:27.010 --> 01:35.150
And as you can see once again there is some weight painting we need to do as we turn this up.

01:35.150 --> 01:42.740
We need this part of the foot to stay flat on the ground and as we rotate back we need this heel edge

01:42.740 --> 01:46.740
right here to stay on the ground as well but we can do that.

01:46.760 --> 01:49.080
We will do that here in just a bit.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.400
Let me press Ault ah and let's do this for the other side.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.790
I'll select the toe.

01:54.110 --> 01:57.710
Let's add a copy rotation constraint.

01:57.890 --> 02:03.770
We'll choose armature and for this will choose TOE ROLL.

02:03.920 --> 02:09.280
AH and we'll change from world to local.

02:09.310 --> 02:11.800
Lastly will choose offset.

02:11.800 --> 02:12.540
And here we go.

02:12.550 --> 02:14.080
That should do it for us.

02:14.140 --> 02:15.530
Or this foot as well.

02:16.180 --> 02:16.590
Yeah.

02:17.620 --> 02:19.470
It's working pretty well.

02:19.470 --> 02:20.290
Okay.

02:20.450 --> 02:21.030
All right.

02:21.050 --> 02:23.020
Ah to clear the rotation for that.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.660
Now the knees.

02:25.680 --> 02:33.450
Well we need to do is create controls for these knees that will allow us to manually point them in the

02:33.450 --> 02:39.720
direction that we want to do that we're going to need to add a new bone here for each of the knees.

02:39.870 --> 02:47.620
So let's go back over into edit mode and I will select one of these knee joints here and let's move

02:47.650 --> 02:52.840
the cursor to here shift as cursor to selected.

02:52.840 --> 03:00.540
Let's create a bone shift a And let's bring this down and get it down to be about the right size that

03:00.540 --> 03:00.960
we want.

03:00.960 --> 03:06.050
So let's say we want it to be about this big here.

03:06.160 --> 03:10.560
Let's also select that bone and duplicate it and put it on the other side as well.

03:10.570 --> 03:16.810
So if I maybe move the cursor over here cursor to selected and I select this bone.

03:16.930 --> 03:25.540
Let's duplicate it with shift D and enter and then let's move it over to the cursor here so shift s

03:26.050 --> 03:30.180
selection to cursor and that'll move it over there.

03:30.220 --> 03:32.980
So let's give these names as well.

03:32.980 --> 03:45.100
This one we should probably call knee control top L and I'll just grab that copy it with control C..

03:46.390 --> 03:50.270
Select that one over there and let's control the.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.650
And change the L to an R.

03:52.870 --> 03:53.290
There we go.

03:53.290 --> 03:56.170
So now we have our two knee control Bones.

03:56.170 --> 04:01.110
I'll take them both now and let's just move them straight out like this.

04:01.120 --> 04:07.630
So we're a little bit out from the character maybe like this and I'm doing them together like this so

04:07.630 --> 04:11.020
they're in the exact same place on each side.

04:11.020 --> 04:17.890
Now what we need to do is have this knee point at these all the time no matter where we move these the

04:17.890 --> 04:24.100
knees should point at them and what we're really going to do is not so much point the knees but we're

04:24.100 --> 04:26.850
going to point the AK chain at these things.

04:26.860 --> 04:30.040
So to do that we need to get back to that inverse.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.380
Semantics constraint panel.

04:32.530 --> 04:38.520
So let's go over to pose mode here and let's select that foot bone.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.170
I mean go to the bone here.

04:41.170 --> 04:42.210
That's foot.

04:42.250 --> 04:47.470
I k there we need to go to that foot dot l bone.

04:47.620 --> 04:54.610
So if we go to our constraints panel here we can see here's that I K panel or that I K constraint.

04:54.970 --> 05:00.850
And in this IKEA constraint panel we have this poll target and that's what that is.

05:00.850 --> 05:06.010
We're gonna target that knee control in this poll target field.

05:06.010 --> 05:14.590
First of all though we need to choose the armature here then for the bone we need to type in knee and

05:14.590 --> 05:17.370
we'll choose that knee control dot l.

05:17.540 --> 05:18.610
There we go.

05:18.610 --> 05:25.150
Now once again it goes crazy but we can take this pole angle and click and drag on and you can see how

05:25.150 --> 05:32.800
we can begin to turn it like this I'm turning it back negative and we wanted to go to negative 90

05:36.510 --> 05:38.470
there we go like that.

05:38.560 --> 05:43.660
So now that knee points at that knee control all the time.

05:43.750 --> 05:52.420
So if we maybe grab this knee control and hit gee look at how that turns along with that object.

05:52.440 --> 05:52.710
All right.

05:52.750 --> 05:59.020
So if we select this foot controlled say and rotate it like this.

05:59.020 --> 06:03.010
Now we want that need to move out and be in line with that.

06:03.010 --> 06:11.530
I can hit G and turn that like this and we can kind of control where that knee is pointing with this

06:11.530 --> 06:13.110
new control here.

06:13.120 --> 06:13.330
All right.

06:13.360 --> 06:20.980
So I'm gonna press Alt are alt G actually a better select everything and I'll press Alt R G.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.200
There we go.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.920
So now let's do that same thing for the other side.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.630
We want to select that foot.

06:28.630 --> 06:30.500
Dot Ah there it is.

06:30.500 --> 06:34.060
I mea make sure in the bone panel here.

06:34.090 --> 06:34.910
There it is.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.260
Put dot R.

06:36.400 --> 06:43.100
Let's go to our constraint panel in the poll target field will choose armature.

06:43.100 --> 06:48.350
And in that Bowen field will choose that knee control right here.

06:48.360 --> 06:53.850
Now control are once again it spins around and is really ugly.

06:53.850 --> 06:59.760
Well let's just type in negative nine to zero and that spins it back around.

06:59.760 --> 07:00.390
And there we go.

07:00.390 --> 07:05.710
We should be able to grab that G and move it back and forth.

07:05.790 --> 07:07.180
Good.

07:07.220 --> 07:12.730
The last thing we should do here is make sure that these knee controls stay with the rig.

07:12.770 --> 07:23.210
So if we took this rig and maybe the put controls down here like this the route and those controls and

07:23.210 --> 07:28.280
hit G and moved it we'd leave our knee controls behind.

07:28.360 --> 07:32.210
I'm going press all g to clear the location.

07:32.210 --> 07:36.800
So let's take these and parent them to a bone in the foot.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.920
We might as well just parent them to the foot controls themselves.

07:40.970 --> 07:50.560
So let's go back into edit mode and we'll select the knee control and then shift click the foot control

07:51.130 --> 07:56.340
and then we'll choose control P and keep offset and we go.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.530
Same thing over here.

07:58.840 --> 08:04.330
Select that foot control control P and keep offset.

08:04.360 --> 08:12.310
So what that means actually now is that when we rotate the foot the knee control will come along and

08:12.310 --> 08:16.960
we can use that foot control to move it away from the direction of the foot.

08:16.990 --> 08:22.660
So let me show you what I mean here if we go to post mode again and I'll select that control when we

08:22.660 --> 08:29.460
turn this now because this is parenthood the knee and the foot will turn in the same direction.

08:29.470 --> 08:31.950
So that just saves an extra step.

08:31.960 --> 08:39.460
Now if we want it to be any different we can take that and move it around like that.

08:39.490 --> 08:39.700
All right.

08:39.730 --> 08:47.520
So I'm going to select everything with the achy old are to clear the rotation of g to clear the location.

08:47.530 --> 08:49.240
And here we go.

08:49.240 --> 08:52.930
So now we pretty much have the rig the way we want it.

08:53.680 --> 09:00.590
Now we need to do is adjust the weights of the feet so that toe and that heel stays on the ground.

09:00.790 --> 09:07.240
And then we need to create control objects that we can use when we animate because we don't want to

09:07.240 --> 09:13.780
actually select the bones here that deform or move the character when we're animating.

09:13.780 --> 09:22.360
We want to select proxy objects control objects and hide the rig away completely because if we accidentally

09:22.360 --> 09:29.170
select the wrong bone and move it or scale it or change it in any way we can destroy the rig.

09:29.170 --> 09:35.350
So we want to keep everything safe and hidden away and just use control objects to animate the character

09:36.250 --> 09:37.480
in the next video.

09:37.480 --> 09:41.650
Let's work on cleaning up the weights for the toe and the heel.
