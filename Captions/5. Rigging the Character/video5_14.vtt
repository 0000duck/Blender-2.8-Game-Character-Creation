WEBVTT

00:00.530 --> 00:05.870
Now in the same way that we mirrored the arm and the leg bones let's mirror these controlled object

00:05.870 --> 00:07.010
bones.

00:07.010 --> 00:12.000
So I just need to go through and select them all of these.

00:12.120 --> 00:21.090
Now let me turn off the gizmo there so I can click all of these and we go and then we want to select

00:21.120 --> 00:22.080
all of these.

00:22.080 --> 00:25.770
So it was this one this one.

00:25.980 --> 00:32.970
Oh I see that I didn't put a dot L at the end of this one here I'll have to be sure and do that this

00:32.970 --> 00:35.720
one and this one.

00:35.940 --> 00:36.390
All right.

00:36.420 --> 00:44.360
So those are all of our control object bones that are on the left side of the character.

00:44.490 --> 00:46.730
Those are the only ones that need to be mirrored over.

00:46.750 --> 00:56.610
So let's now move the cursor shift s cursor to world origin and then let's say move the pivot point

00:57.090 --> 00:59.250
to the 3d cursor.

00:59.370 --> 01:08.070
Now what we can do is press control D and enter and then control them and hit the X key and that will

01:08.070 --> 01:12.150
pop them over to the other side and hit enter.

01:12.150 --> 01:21.660
Now with all of these selected let's go ahead and choose flip names right click names flip names and

01:21.730 --> 01:22.500
we go.

01:22.780 --> 01:23.670
Okay.

01:23.800 --> 01:28.450
Now of course we need to go through and remove the 0 0 1 from all of these.

01:28.450 --> 01:31.880
And let me see what happened with that foot control.

01:31.870 --> 01:35.640
There's the foot control underscore c0.

01:35.890 --> 01:39.280
And here's the CEO dial 0 0 1.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.950
So that's all that data just added a 0 0 1 to it.

01:41.950 --> 01:52.450
So I'll take this and I'll do dot R and I'll select this one and I'll put a dot l there.

01:52.450 --> 01:52.830
Okay.

01:52.860 --> 01:57.250
So now I've got to go through and remove all the 0 0 ones

02:03.790 --> 02:06.790
and the last one the knee.

02:07.060 --> 02:07.760
All right.

02:08.410 --> 02:10.370
Well that was tedious.

02:10.570 --> 02:16.880
I hope the version you're using takes away those 0 0 ones for you.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.190
All right.

02:18.190 --> 02:25.590
Now we need to parent these bones appropriately so they stay with the character and stay with the bone

02:25.600 --> 02:26.890
they're affecting.

02:27.010 --> 02:35.560
So this bone up here on the top we probably just need to parent this to the head bone because ultimately

02:35.560 --> 02:41.260
what we're gonna do is have this control object before the neck bone.

02:41.260 --> 02:47.920
If you recall we're just going to control the neck bone but when we control the neck bone the head bone

02:47.920 --> 02:53.410
is going to come along since its parent it as well so let's parent it to the head bone or select this

02:53.860 --> 03:01.210
shift select the head bone press control P and choose keep offset Moss are going to change this back

03:01.210 --> 03:03.770
to median point here.

03:03.820 --> 03:04.670
All right.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.830
So now let's take a look at this one.

03:08.170 --> 03:11.690
This bone here I don't think I want it to stay.

03:11.710 --> 03:14.270
Parents to the upper arm bone.

03:14.290 --> 03:17.600
I want it to stay parents to the spine too.

03:17.730 --> 03:23.010
So I mean it's like this shift select spine to control P and keep offset.

03:23.050 --> 03:30.690
And then I'm going to go through and parent these control P keep offset parent.

03:31.040 --> 03:41.860
These and then I'm going to go through and parent each one of these here control P keep offset these

03:41.860 --> 03:48.780
two these two and on down here as well

03:52.570 --> 03:53.110
okay.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.500
We've got those.

03:54.590 --> 03:57.470
I think I better go do these while I'm here.

03:57.470 --> 04:03.800
Control P keep offset and then each one of these like this just like the other side

04:07.080 --> 04:08.430
this one and this one

04:16.820 --> 04:27.560
and this and this up I better turn off the gizmos so I can click through their this and this this and

04:27.560 --> 04:27.850
this.

04:30.920 --> 04:40.300
Okay we've got those now let's now parent this to spine one control P keep offset this just spine one

04:40.330 --> 04:48.370
oh excuse me that was spine to appear now this one two spine one control P keep offset and this will

04:48.370 --> 04:49.570
parent to the root.

04:49.570 --> 05:00.910
Here down here we should probably parent all of these bones all of these that we created to that main

05:00.910 --> 05:02.260
foot control.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.300
So let's take this one.

05:04.300 --> 05:15.160
Select that one the put control control P keep offset this one and here control P keep offset and our

05:15.160 --> 05:20.090
toe bone here select this control P and keep offset.

05:20.360 --> 05:27.980
Okay so all of those are parents to this main foot control bone this one can be parents just to the

05:27.980 --> 05:35.320
knee bone here troll P and keep offset and then we're gonna go to the other side and do the same thing.

05:35.320 --> 05:45.670
So this one and foot control this one here the foot controls CEO and the main foot control control P

05:45.730 --> 06:00.630
keep offset the toe bone and foot control and then the knee to the knee control P keep offset Okay so

06:00.630 --> 06:07.830
there we go I think we have them all parenting the way we want them now we can begin actually setting

06:07.830 --> 06:12.760
up the custom shapes so let's go into pose mode for that.

06:12.780 --> 06:22.090
Let's come over here switch to pose mode now for this we can begin setting up all the shapes the first

06:22.090 --> 06:29.140
one let's do is the neck bone Let's select that let's come over here to our bone panel and let's choose

06:29.200 --> 06:33.850
viewport display and here we can select a custom object.

06:33.850 --> 06:37.090
So for this I want it to be a circle.

06:37.180 --> 06:45.430
So we'll click this and see how now the bone has been replaced by a circle I mean you click out of that

06:45.430 --> 06:52.360
here you can see it's just now that circle that we created here on the grid that we hid away under our

06:52.360 --> 06:57.800
control objects it's using that shape to replace the bone.

06:57.980 --> 07:04.620
So what we want to do is place it up here on top of the head and that's why we created that bone there.

07:04.670 --> 07:07.850
So over here custom shape transform.

07:07.850 --> 07:09.100
We click this.

07:09.230 --> 07:15.620
Now we find that head underscore SEO so here it is.

07:15.620 --> 07:16.580
Head underscore.

07:16.590 --> 07:19.400
Control object right there.

07:19.520 --> 07:24.760
We'll click this and there it is pops up to the top of the head.

07:24.770 --> 07:30.170
Now we can click and drag on this scale and make it as big or as small as we want.

07:30.170 --> 07:31.830
So I think I'll just type in two.

07:32.030 --> 07:34.580
I think that'll be just fine.

07:34.580 --> 07:40.560
Now watch what happens when we select it and then I'll hit our two times.

07:40.850 --> 07:42.020
And there we go.

07:42.020 --> 07:50.360
So we're actually controlling the head from this control object but it's rotating at the neck bone right

07:50.360 --> 07:52.490
here we go.

07:52.500 --> 07:59.930
I'm going to press Alt are and so what we can do now is take this bone and this bone since we don't

07:59.930 --> 08:03.920
need it and move it to a new bone layer.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.900
Let's come over here to this panel.

08:05.900 --> 08:10.650
The object data panel and you can see we have layers here.

08:10.720 --> 08:19.160
So what let's do is come over to pose changed bone layers and let's move it to the second layer.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.560
And there we go.

08:20.630 --> 08:27.930
Now you can see them over here and here is everything else so that's the way we're going to do it.

08:27.940 --> 08:35.590
We're going to create these custom objects clean the bones out from the rig put them over here in this

08:35.590 --> 08:36.790
other layer.

08:36.790 --> 08:42.140
So we'll have a nice clean setup with just the control objects and the character.

08:42.220 --> 08:43.350
Let's do one more here.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.200
Let's work on this one here.

08:46.330 --> 08:50.700
So let's come over to the bone panel select our custom object.

08:50.710 --> 08:54.340
I'm going to use a circle again.

08:54.350 --> 08:55.070
There it is.

08:55.070 --> 08:56.720
But it's going the wrong way.

08:56.810 --> 08:59.900
And that's why we created this bone here.

08:59.900 --> 09:07.250
So let's select that that was what spine one means scroll all the way down here that was spine.

09:07.430 --> 09:11.840
No scuse me that spine to underscore SEO.

09:12.010 --> 09:12.650
And there we go.

09:13.610 --> 09:17.370
So now we can increase the size of that.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.520
Maybe I'll increase it about like this.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.580
Well let's call that.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.020
Let's try one point for

09:24.890 --> 09:25.420
that.

09:25.430 --> 09:31.650
There you go in your values may be a little bit different depending on how big you created the bone.

09:31.690 --> 09:33.260
It still seems a little too big.

09:33.260 --> 09:36.280
Let's try one point three something like that.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.070
Yeah OK.

09:38.100 --> 09:46.340
So now if we select this bone here and hit are two times we can rotate that around and there you go.

09:46.390 --> 09:47.150
Ah.

09:47.370 --> 09:50.970
Now let's take this bone come over here.

09:51.060 --> 09:53.790
We want to move it to this panel right.

09:53.820 --> 10:01.060
So let's go to oppose change bone layers move it over there and there they are.

10:01.510 --> 10:06.600
Okay let's go back to this bone panel here and let's do one more.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.540
I'm just gonna roll this up here.

10:08.580 --> 10:09.410
Let's do one more.

10:09.420 --> 10:13.720
Let's do this choose our custom object.

10:13.720 --> 10:16.030
It'll be a circle.

10:16.030 --> 10:17.770
Choose the bone.

10:17.770 --> 10:20.270
It'll be spine one this time right.

10:20.290 --> 10:22.750
Spine one underscore SEO.

10:22.780 --> 10:23.940
There it is.

10:24.220 --> 10:29.670
And let's scale it out and let's go with one point four.

10:29.770 --> 10:33.970
Now we better make it one point five and we go.

10:34.020 --> 10:37.290
So this is how we're going to set up the entire character.

10:37.290 --> 10:40.980
So we only see these control objects when they grab this bone.

10:40.980 --> 10:45.630
Now we don't need this one and go to oppose change bone layers.

10:45.660 --> 10:47.330
Put it on layer two.

10:47.610 --> 10:49.050
And then it goes away.

10:49.820 --> 10:56.210
So if I select this I can control the character like that.

10:56.410 --> 10:56.850
All right.

10:56.860 --> 11:00.790
So in the next video will continue on creating our custom shapes.
