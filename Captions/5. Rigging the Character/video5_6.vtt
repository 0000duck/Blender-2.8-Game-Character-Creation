WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:06.650
Let's take a look at the root bone here I'll press shift right click and choose root and let's see what's

00:06.650 --> 00:13.550
going on here so it looks like there is some influence bleeding out onto the legs if we choose the upper

00:13.550 --> 00:21.000
leg l we can see some problems here we don't want the leg to be moving the hips.

00:21.350 --> 00:27.200
Looks like the same thing is going on over here so we've got some work to do first of all let's begin

00:27.200 --> 00:34.220
with the root bone for this when I selected here it selects that Vertex group over in the list over

00:34.220 --> 00:34.930
here.

00:35.120 --> 00:41.600
So let's then tab into edit mode and hover over the legs and choose these.

00:41.870 --> 00:45.230
And then let's click remove.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.110
Let's see how that worked shift.

00:48.120 --> 00:53.350
Right click route Yeah I think that'll be good.

00:53.350 --> 01:00.630
Now let's select the upper leg bone and for this one we want to get rid of the hips.

01:00.730 --> 01:03.430
We want to remove all the vertices for the hips.

01:03.460 --> 01:13.100
So let's tab into edit mode I will press L to select that and then let's click remove and we go let's

01:13.110 --> 01:16.780
try that yep that worked there.

01:17.030 --> 01:22.500
Let's select this one now and same thing needs to happen here.

01:22.610 --> 01:30.420
Need to tab and edit mode hover over that and press the L key and click remove.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.170
Now let's see how we're doing here.

01:33.980 --> 01:35.720
OK that looks good.

01:37.480 --> 01:38.400
That looks good.

01:38.410 --> 01:41.350
And shift right click.

01:41.530 --> 01:42.810
That looks OK there.

01:43.680 --> 01:50.280
Now I see a problem here in that we're not going to have anything influencing these hips I've taken

01:50.280 --> 01:53.750
away the hips For the torso and the legs.

01:53.760 --> 01:58.000
I think the root bone needs to be what controls the hips.

01:58.020 --> 02:06.330
So what we can do is tab and edit mode select all of the points for the hips and then we can come over

02:06.330 --> 02:15.450
here and click a sign we can actually assign the weights at 100 percent and assign these vertices to

02:15.540 --> 02:21.860
the root bone vertex group so I'll click assign There we go.

02:21.860 --> 02:27.040
Now we tab back in select the route bone.

02:27.070 --> 02:27.790
There we go.

02:28.510 --> 02:34.540
Now we've got the hips and that crotch area being influenced by the root bone.

02:34.540 --> 02:36.310
I think that's what we want.

02:37.010 --> 02:39.110
I think that'll work pretty well.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.310
Well OK let's come up here and take a look at the arms.

02:42.380 --> 02:49.730
If we shift right click this we can choose up arm L and frankly I think that looks pretty good.

02:49.730 --> 02:55.430
We've got full influence up here and it falling off to here.

02:55.430 --> 02:57.260
That looks pretty good.

02:57.260 --> 03:03.560
However I don't know that we need influence all the way down to here from that bone.

03:03.560 --> 03:13.250
So what we could do for that is go to our active tool tab here go to subtract subtract one hundred percent

03:14.000 --> 03:20.510
and then maybe I'll hit the f key and expand the brush a bit and then I'll also come up here and turn

03:20.510 --> 03:25.550
off that face election mode and actually with that turned off.

03:25.580 --> 03:25.860
Yeah.

03:25.880 --> 03:26.720
Here we go.

03:26.720 --> 03:30.260
It doesn't look as bad with that turned off.

03:31.420 --> 03:35.460
And we go just remove that a bit.

03:35.460 --> 03:43.170
Let's press shift right click and choose the lower arm and that doesn't look too bad except it's bleeding

03:43.170 --> 03:45.480
over here into the wrist.

03:45.480 --> 03:50.750
Let's also select the hand bone here and take a look at that.

03:50.820 --> 03:58.410
So I think what we need to do here is one increase the influence of the hand on the wrist polygons here

03:58.950 --> 04:07.530
but also I think we need to remove the influence here on the wrist from the lower arm bone.

04:07.530 --> 04:15.350
I want to be able to rotate the hand in the wrist without any influence from the lower arm.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.340
Well let's do is tab into edit mode.

04:17.370 --> 04:24.030
Let's go to face mode and I want to press Alt and click on an edge between two of the faces and select

04:24.030 --> 04:31.050
that whole face loop there and then I'll come over here to the Object data panel and with the lower

04:31.050 --> 04:34.110
arm selected I'll just click remove.

04:34.110 --> 04:35.670
Here we go.

04:35.670 --> 04:38.520
So free tab back into weight paint mode.

04:38.520 --> 04:45.520
Select this now the influence on the wrist is completely gone from the lower arm.

04:45.570 --> 04:56.820
Now let's select this the hand and let's tab back into edit mode and let's assign 100 percent to those

04:56.820 --> 04:57.330
vertices.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.280
There we go.

05:00.930 --> 05:04.210
Select that again and there we are.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.410
Okay that's good.

05:06.410 --> 05:12.330
Now for these bones I think I think these are probably gonna be just fine.

05:12.330 --> 05:18.850
I'm not gonna really be using these a whole lot if ever I think these are probably just fine.

05:20.210 --> 05:21.500
And we go.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.380
All right.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.790
So I need to go through and do this same thing.

05:25.790 --> 05:27.300
On the right arm.

05:27.410 --> 05:32.660
So let's do that quickly let's select the lower arm.

05:32.660 --> 05:33.260
There it is.

05:33.260 --> 05:45.260
Let's tap into edit mode select these bases here and remove and then will select that hand tab into

05:45.280 --> 05:47.970
edit mode and assign.

05:48.020 --> 05:50.500
There we go.

05:50.530 --> 05:54.330
OK so now we have that taken care of.

05:54.370 --> 05:56.080
What about the head.

05:56.080 --> 06:01.180
Well if we choose the neck that's what we have right there.

06:01.180 --> 06:05.340
And if we choose the head that's what we have right there.

06:05.350 --> 06:13.770
However I think all we're really going to need is to use the neck to move the head because the head's

06:13.780 --> 06:20.710
never gonna really bend at the neck or the chin or anywhere else other than right down here at the connection

06:20.710 --> 06:21.790
of the torso.

06:21.850 --> 06:28.870
But I went ahead and created a neck and a head bone because in unity it's going to be looking for that

06:29.500 --> 06:35.650
but just because it's going to be looking for that doesn't mean we have to use it necessarily.

06:35.650 --> 06:42.280
So what I want to do is just control the head from the neck bone just the whole thing from the neck

06:42.280 --> 06:46.940
bone and then the head bone will just be there and we'll never really use it.

06:46.960 --> 06:54.850
So to do that I'm just going to tap back into edit mode at the El key for the head and the hair and

06:54.850 --> 07:01.790
with the neck vertex group selected I'll click a sign and we go.

07:01.800 --> 07:09.090
So now if we choose the neck there we have it the head still has influence but it doesn't really matter

07:09.120 --> 07:12.130
because we're never going to use it anyway.

07:12.150 --> 07:13.470
All right.

07:13.470 --> 07:20.280
So now what let's do is go back to object mode and then let's select the rig and let's give it a try.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.710
Here I'm going to select the neck.

07:22.710 --> 07:28.380
Go to the rotate tool and I'm just going to click and drag in here in this sphere and you can see that's

07:28.380 --> 07:30.780
the way it's going to move there.

07:31.020 --> 07:36.780
And I think that's OK I'll press ult are to remove the rotation there.

07:37.020 --> 07:42.060
Let's select this bone and move this around and I think that'll work.

07:42.060 --> 07:42.740
OK.

07:42.750 --> 07:46.980
I'm never gonna be moving it more than about like this or like this.

07:46.980 --> 07:54.710
Just to give a little bit of squash and stretch when he hits the ground maybe ult ah let's select this

07:54.710 --> 07:56.860
one do the same thing with this.

07:56.880 --> 07:57.080
Yeah.

07:57.110 --> 08:03.200
This is going to once again rotate right there between the hip and the torso and that's fine.

08:04.090 --> 08:06.490
Hold are.

08:06.730 --> 08:14.590
Let's take a look at the legs here or click and drag this one in the x axis and you can see it's just

08:14.680 --> 08:17.170
moving the leg and that's good.

08:18.100 --> 08:23.620
And then if we take this one here this will just be a little bit of a bend here.

08:23.630 --> 08:25.770
Now look at what's happening here.

08:26.960 --> 08:31.140
If I click and drag this can you see how it's moving here.

08:31.340 --> 08:36.310
You don't really want this bone to be moving this part of the leg.

08:36.560 --> 08:39.320
So let's quickly try and fix that.

08:39.350 --> 08:46.050
I'll go back to object mode select the character weight paint mode.

08:46.150 --> 08:54.000
Let's shift right click and select the lower leg and you can see where the influence is up here.

08:54.130 --> 08:54.780
You see that.

08:54.780 --> 09:00.510
So what we can do is go to our active tool go to subtract.

09:00.880 --> 09:09.290
And I will just try and paint some of this out like this and we go we don't need all of that up in here

09:15.050 --> 09:20.950
we go we should do the same thing over here.

09:21.090 --> 09:28.240
We don't need all of this either.

09:28.250 --> 09:28.700
All right.

09:29.060 --> 09:30.590
So that's our process.

09:30.590 --> 09:35.570
We need to go through and figure out where we need to adjust the weights.

09:35.570 --> 09:43.010
There may be more we need to do in the foot area but I'm going to wait until we set up our reverse foot

09:43.010 --> 09:49.940
roll rig to then test the foot a little bit more precisely to see what we need in terms of the weight

09:49.940 --> 09:51.090
painting.

09:51.110 --> 09:53.030
So we'll begin that coming up next.
