WEBVTT

00:00.590 --> 00:07.760
Now one of the thing that distinguishes a very fast walk from a run is that at some point in time in

00:07.820 --> 00:14.510
a run cycle Both feet are up off the ground and the way I have it here the problem is I mean go back

00:14.510 --> 00:16.490
to the side view here.

00:16.490 --> 00:23.210
Problem is here even at frame six there's a toe still on the ground right.

00:23.240 --> 00:27.370
And then we go to the contact here for the right foot.

00:27.410 --> 00:35.000
So my problem is is that he's never really completely off the ground so I need to get that right here.

00:35.000 --> 00:43.340
Let's take that foot control that foot roll and let's press old ah and clear the rotation on that and

00:43.340 --> 00:49.640
then let's grab the actual foot control and let's move this up and rotate it.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.500
So we're kind of like this.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.320
We're kind of up in the air like this.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.510
Like that.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.520
And that's probably all we need for that.

00:58.550 --> 01:03.910
Let's go over to frame 12 here and yeah let's do the same thing here.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.130
Let's take that foot roll.

01:06.140 --> 01:14.570
Press all are and then let's grab the foot control and bring it up and rotate it back like that.

01:14.570 --> 01:14.980
All right.

01:15.080 --> 01:18.840
Frame six frame twelve.

01:19.610 --> 01:25.770
Yeah let's kind of like this a little bit better.

01:25.780 --> 01:28.780
Let's go like this okay.

01:28.790 --> 01:33.560
Frame six frame twelve six.

01:33.890 --> 01:44.010
Well there's a bit of movement with the hips here that I'm not Yeah.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.560
Let's select those hips.

01:45.560 --> 01:54.340
Let me deselect everything down here select the hips and let's get well let's see.

01:54.370 --> 02:01.100
So this frame five and 11 are pretty good all right.

02:01.100 --> 02:11.460
In terms of the hips and the position frame six comes down just a bit and frame 12 comes down even more

02:11.490 --> 02:13.230
so that's not quite right.

02:13.230 --> 02:13.650
Huh.

02:18.300 --> 02:22.260
Well what let's do is take this and let's go out and create a key frame.

02:22.260 --> 02:26.670
I'm going to press I and choose location and rotation.

02:26.670 --> 02:31.910
And now with this created I'm just going to duplicate it shift D and move it over to here.

02:32.310 --> 02:33.440
Let's see how that works.

02:34.850 --> 02:35.160
Yeah.

02:35.170 --> 02:39.380
That's better now we just need to get the feet into the correct position

02:41.820 --> 02:43.290
six and 12

02:47.260 --> 02:48.770
and we go that's not too bad.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.440
Yeah.

02:53.700 --> 02:54.170
All right.

02:54.660 --> 02:58.560
So now let's give it a try.

02:58.670 --> 03:01.180
I'll deselect everything.

03:01.290 --> 03:10.110
We can also come over here and hide the armature hide it right here and then we can get the spacebar.

03:10.140 --> 03:21.220
Let's see how he's doing we can tumble around and see him go Yeah I think uh think that works pretty

03:21.220 --> 03:25.260
well.

03:25.430 --> 03:26.740
Okay good.

03:26.740 --> 03:27.900
I'll hit the spacebar.

03:27.910 --> 03:29.620
I'll go and bring the armature back.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.060
Here we go.

03:31.060 --> 03:40.450
Now let's think about the 2D face the entire animation here the entire cycle is only half a second long.

03:40.840 --> 03:48.120
So if we had him blink anywhere in here or really do anything in here he would do it twice a second.

03:48.260 --> 03:49.610
And that's a lot.

03:50.080 --> 03:57.490
So I don't think we can really have an animation happening during the run cycle but what we can do is

03:57.490 --> 04:03.520
change his expression and just have that one expression hold while he runs.

04:03.520 --> 04:09.970
So I think what we really need to do is just change his eyebrows and change the mouth.

04:09.970 --> 04:17.380
Let's go ahead and come out of pose mode to object mode and then we can select that grease pencil object

04:18.250 --> 04:22.130
and then let's come over here from object and go to draw.

04:22.150 --> 04:22.510
All right.

04:22.540 --> 04:27.730
So now we can see our layers over here for the brows.

04:27.730 --> 04:35.230
Well let's go to brow El here and and we can access all of these at the same time in edit mode because

04:35.500 --> 04:36.890
it's all one object.

04:36.940 --> 04:43.890
It's like having a 3-D model with a bunch of different pieces but all one object kind of like the character

04:43.900 --> 04:49.670
we've got the head and the arms and the hair and the legs but we've combined them all into one object.

04:49.750 --> 04:53.470
Same kind of thing with the grease pencil over here as well.

04:53.470 --> 05:00.340
So I'm in a tab in the edit mode and what I'll do is I'll just select one of these and I'll hit ah and

05:00.340 --> 05:07.200
let's turn them down and make them angry determined

05:11.850 --> 05:13.400
you go goes something like this.

05:13.430 --> 05:14.410
Let's see.

05:14.420 --> 05:18.240
Oh that's that's very angry.

05:18.490 --> 05:22.270
Maybe not that much about something like it was

05:25.310 --> 05:28.130
maybe he's more devious than angry.

05:28.130 --> 05:30.730
Let's let's let's go with that huh.

05:30.740 --> 05:31.030
All right.

05:31.060 --> 05:39.010
So we've got I accidentally tumbled around and went into user perspective over here in the 2D view.

05:39.010 --> 05:42.670
So what I need to do is go back to look through the camera.

05:42.670 --> 05:46.230
To do that I can just hit the zero key on the numb pad.

05:46.240 --> 05:46.830
There we go.

05:47.610 --> 05:49.200
OK you know what I'm gonna do.

05:49.210 --> 05:56.670
I'm going to take the mouth layer here and I'm gonna turn it off to create a new layer and I'm going

05:56.670 --> 05:59.770
to call it mouth sneer.

05:59.770 --> 06:01.270
Here we go.

06:01.270 --> 06:10.790
And in this layer I will take this line tool and I'll just.

06:11.150 --> 06:12.050
I don't want to do this.

06:12.050 --> 06:14.460
I want to make it straight.

06:14.610 --> 06:16.290
Let me undo that.

06:16.290 --> 06:18.120
That isn't quite thick enough.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.960
I'll take it back up to five pixels.

06:20.970 --> 06:24.910
Let's say and I'll draw like this.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.350
Hit enter.

06:26.350 --> 06:32.140
Now let's tab into edit mode and select that and let's uh rotate it.

06:32.160 --> 06:42.110
I'm not sure how he should maybe you should kinda be like this.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.220
He's very determined there.

06:44.220 --> 06:44.940
Let me.

06:46.830 --> 06:48.340
Move it over just a bit.

06:49.980 --> 06:50.510
And tilt it.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.050
Not quite so much.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.630
Let's try that.

06:53.670 --> 06:54.210
Yes.

06:54.210 --> 06:55.170
And maybe there you go.

06:55.170 --> 06:57.150
He's very determined.

06:57.180 --> 06:58.050
Yeah let's.

06:58.260 --> 06:59.710
Let's go with that.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.740
OK so there we go.

07:01.740 --> 07:07.290
Now we've got our 2D face as well for the run cycle.

07:07.410 --> 07:15.330
What we can do here is we can render this out just this single frame to be used when he runs.

07:15.330 --> 07:17.610
Let's make sure everything is still correct.

07:17.610 --> 07:23.100
We'll go to our output and we've got this going to the idol folder.

07:23.100 --> 07:24.300
I don't think we want that.

07:24.300 --> 07:33.890
Let's create a new folder here and call it run and we'll select that and hit except we've still got

07:33.890 --> 07:35.840
it at 24 frames per second.

07:35.840 --> 07:39.420
Two hundred and fifty six pixels that's good.

07:39.590 --> 07:44.910
If we go to the render panel we've still got film Alpha transparent.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.200
That's good.

07:46.220 --> 07:53.850
So what let's do this time with our character and other objects hidden in the render view.

07:53.870 --> 07:58.980
Let's come over here to render and render image.

07:59.360 --> 07:59.740
All right.

07:59.750 --> 08:07.460
So now that we've rendered that one frame out we just need to go to image save as and let's put it in

08:07.460 --> 08:18.950
that run folder renders run and we'll call this run base image.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.160
There we go.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.970
Save as.

08:22.060 --> 08:22.320
All right.

08:22.330 --> 08:24.640
Let's go check it out.

08:24.660 --> 08:27.810
So here's the idol folder with all the renders in it.

08:27.810 --> 08:35.950
Let's go back to the renders folder the run folder and there is our run face image.

08:35.950 --> 08:39.150
There we go OK.

08:39.190 --> 08:43.750
So we now have the run animation complete.

08:43.780 --> 08:52.300
I'm going to press control est and save the scene but I'm also going to go to File Save a copy here

08:53.080 --> 09:05.320
and let's go into our exports and we'll call this player run right here and save.

09:05.320 --> 09:05.920
There we go.

09:06.310 --> 09:12.200
So now we've got our idol and our run the next step is our jump.

09:12.310 --> 09:15.190
So we'll start working on that coming up next.
