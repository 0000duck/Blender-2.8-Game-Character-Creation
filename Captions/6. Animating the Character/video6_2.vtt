WEBVTT

00:00.620 --> 00:05.230
Continuing with the setup of the interface let's take a look at the timelines.

00:05.240 --> 00:09.640
Now we're going to need a grease pencil timeline that we have here.

00:09.650 --> 00:13.420
We're also going to need a dope sheet timeline right here.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.380
So let's choose that.

00:15.380 --> 00:20.120
In addition we're gonna need to see several unrelated channels.

00:20.330 --> 00:26.210
We're going to need to see the grease pencil and we're going to need to be able to see the character

00:26.210 --> 00:31.250
in Poe's mode and see those key frames so this button right here.

00:31.310 --> 00:35.000
This only includes channels relating to selected objects.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.470
We're gonna need to uncheck this because we're gonna want to see everything here on our timeline.

00:40.490 --> 00:47.090
Also when I scroll the mouse wheel here you can see that one timeline can move independently of the

00:47.090 --> 00:53.180
other timeline and even though this is the same time the same thing happening to have them two different

00:53.180 --> 00:56.390
sizes like this can be really confusing.

00:56.390 --> 01:03.710
So what this do is come over here to view analysts choose lock time to other windows and also down here

01:03.710 --> 01:08.240
on this timeline view lock time to other windows.

01:08.450 --> 01:08.990
And there we go.

01:08.990 --> 01:16.400
So now if we scroll and move these around you can see they stay locked together and that's really helpful

01:16.400 --> 01:18.660
as we go forward with this.

01:18.680 --> 01:23.320
Now I think what we ought to do is work on the material of the base object.

01:23.360 --> 01:28.460
Currently it's got the same material that the character does and I don't think that's going to work.

01:28.460 --> 01:35.570
So let's come over here to our shading tab right here and I'll hit the period key to zoom in and let's

01:36.080 --> 01:43.400
just select that one face object and as you can see it's got the character material on it here.

01:43.460 --> 01:47.690
What I'd like to do is create a transparent material here.

01:47.690 --> 01:54.050
It's just a temporary material that we're gonna be using here in blender just so we can see the 2D face

01:54.080 --> 01:59.950
as we're animating and also so we can test it once we render the animation out.

02:00.110 --> 02:04.570
We're going to create a whole new transparent material once we get to unity.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.560
But for here I think it's good to have it while we're testing.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.490
So what let's do is here.

02:10.580 --> 02:18.170
Let's go ahead and remove the character slot for the GEO base idle object I'll just hit the minus button

02:18.170 --> 02:22.700
here and then let's click new and let's give this a new name.

02:22.700 --> 02:29.480
I'm going to call this b m80 for Blender material just so we can keep it straight and then I'll call

02:29.480 --> 02:33.210
this base idle that.

02:33.260 --> 02:34.020
Okay.

02:34.340 --> 02:38.180
So now that we've done that let's try and make it transparent.

02:38.360 --> 02:44.810
To do that I think first we're going to need a transparent shader so let's press shift a and choose

02:45.050 --> 02:47.040
shader transparent.

02:47.120 --> 02:55.660
Right there we go and then we're going to want to mix these two together so let's press shift a and

02:55.660 --> 03:02.620
create a mix shader right here and I'll drop it right here and it'll connect up but I kind of want this

03:02.620 --> 03:09.130
one on the top socket so I'll put that there and the other one will automatically move down and then

03:09.160 --> 03:15.730
I need to connect something up to the factor socket here in the mix shader So what let's do is let's

03:15.730 --> 03:22.660
just create a blank image texture node and just plug that in some of the press Shift A and we'll go

03:22.660 --> 03:29.440
to texture image texture and I don't even need to bring a texture into this I'm just gonna take the

03:29.440 --> 03:32.100
alpha and drag it right over here.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.340
There we go.

03:33.340 --> 03:39.340
Now if we were in eevee that should have worked but if you recall a long time ago we switched over to

03:39.340 --> 03:43.690
cycles render engine to do that bake.

03:43.690 --> 03:49.960
So let's switch back to evey here and then in our materials panel right here.

03:50.440 --> 03:57.250
If we scroll down or twirl down the principal be SDF shader I'll just twirl this down.

03:57.250 --> 04:03.070
Now if we scroll all the way down here under settings we've got a blend mode and we can change this

04:03.070 --> 04:11.720
from opaque to Alpha blend and now we've got a clear material here and that's what we want.

04:11.770 --> 04:17.440
As I said this is a temp material for working on our animation here in blender but I think it'll be

04:17.440 --> 04:18.490
helpful.

04:18.520 --> 04:18.780
All right.

04:18.790 --> 04:25.990
Now that we have that what we should probably do is also UVA map this object because we're going to

04:25.990 --> 04:32.800
be applying 2D textures to it both here in Blender and in unity so we can go over to our U V editing

04:32.800 --> 04:37.470
tab over here and I'll hit the period key and there we go.

04:37.480 --> 04:44.080
So we can get rid of this normal map here we can click the X here and get rid of that.

04:44.170 --> 04:47.650
Now what let's do is just select all of this.

04:47.650 --> 04:54.520
I'll just hover over here and hit the L key and you can see our U V map here from when this was a part

04:54.520 --> 04:55.490
of the character.

04:55.660 --> 05:02.230
Before we do anything let's go ahead and tab into object mode and press control a and let's apply the

05:02.230 --> 05:04.450
rotation and scale here.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.840
Now let's tap back into edit mode.

05:06.970 --> 05:10.080
Press you and unwrap and there we go.

05:10.090 --> 05:11.870
Now it's turned.

05:11.890 --> 05:12.840
I want to turn it.

05:13.090 --> 05:17.680
So this part right here near the chin is at the bottom.

05:17.710 --> 05:22.530
Well let's test can formal here see if that helps that actually helped a bit.

05:22.540 --> 05:23.860
Now didn't it.

05:23.860 --> 05:25.270
So let's do that.

05:25.270 --> 05:31.240
Let's go ahead and turn it over here in the movie Ed all press are 9 0 in that alternate.

05:31.480 --> 05:36.160
Now I'd like to make sure that all of these edges are perfectly straight and of course I want to pack

05:36.160 --> 05:38.230
it into the zero to one space here.

05:38.230 --> 05:45.100
Let's come up to UVA and let's choose pack islands and that puts it in there but I'm going to turn it

05:45.400 --> 05:53.670
uncheck the rotate box here and that puts it within the 0 to 1 space so let's make sure all the edges

05:53.670 --> 05:54.510
are straight here.

05:54.510 --> 06:01.890
I'll press Alt A to D select and then since I'm in vertex mode here I can press the B key and border

06:01.890 --> 06:03.130
select these.

06:03.150 --> 06:06.800
Now I want to ensure that those are perfectly straight up and down.

06:06.810 --> 06:16.640
So what I'll do is right click and then I will choose a line X and that will make those perfectly straight.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.110
Let's do that again here.

06:18.120 --> 06:25.770
Let me zoom out a bit now on select those and then I'll press B and then to this right click the line

06:25.780 --> 06:34.120
X and we go and I'm just gonna go through and do this for all of these you're right.

06:34.130 --> 06:39.780
Click a line X and over here as well OK.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.460
So now we've got those.

06:41.460 --> 06:48.230
Let's do the horizontal ones our border select this and choose a line why now.

06:48.250 --> 06:56.670
And that just ensures that those are all perfectly straight right click align y and be for border select

06:57.810 --> 06:59.580
right click align y.

06:59.600 --> 06:59.980
Okay.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.780
So that ensures that all of that is perfectly straight.

07:03.780 --> 07:07.690
Okay so we have our face you ve mapped.

07:07.690 --> 07:14.170
Now let's now go back to our 2D animation screen layout and let's work on this here.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.070
We can hide some of these objects just in this view.

07:17.070 --> 07:20.640
So all we see is our 2D screen here.

07:20.640 --> 07:28.170
So let's come over to this pull down this object types visibility and let's turn off the mesh visibility

07:28.170 --> 07:33.870
for this view and let's also turn off the armature visibility.

07:33.870 --> 07:34.990
There we go.

07:35.100 --> 07:42.420
And then over here in overlays we could turn off the grid right here we go.

07:42.420 --> 07:42.830
All right.

07:42.840 --> 07:43.980
I think that looks pretty good.

07:43.980 --> 07:45.660
I just wanted that clean.

07:45.660 --> 07:48.420
So all we see is our 2D strokes.

07:48.420 --> 07:53.910
And then let's go ahead and create our grease pencil object that we'll be using to actually draw the

07:53.910 --> 07:54.830
face.

07:54.840 --> 08:02.760
So with the cursor still here in the center of the face what I'll do is go ahead and press shift a and

08:02.760 --> 08:05.760
I'll choose grease pencil and blank.

08:06.140 --> 08:10.190
And that pops it right into where the 3D cursor is.

08:10.200 --> 08:14.280
Now we've got this object over here it's called g pencil.

08:14.340 --> 08:20.310
Let's change the name to GP face.

08:20.490 --> 08:21.390
There we go.

08:21.390 --> 08:22.160
OK.

08:22.320 --> 08:28.150
And now we need to parent it to that head bone just like we did the face object.

08:28.170 --> 08:33.060
So with this selected let's go ahead and shift click the bone.

08:33.090 --> 08:35.460
Oh we better go into Po's mode here.

08:35.490 --> 08:42.220
So I'm going to select that GP base shift click the bone and then shift click it again.

08:42.270 --> 08:46.670
Now it's press control P and parent it to the bone.

08:46.740 --> 08:54.330
So if we choose the head bone now up here and here are two times we can roll that around and we can

08:54.330 --> 08:58.580
see that the grease pencil object comes along for the ride.

08:58.620 --> 08:59.130
That's good.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.220
OK.

09:00.270 --> 09:05.060
Now the last thing I want to get rid of this relationship line and that origin.

09:05.100 --> 09:11.400
So once again we can come over to overlays and turn off the relationship line and the origin there.

09:11.400 --> 09:16.490
So we've got a nice clean interface ready to go for us.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.940
Oh and one last thing.

09:17.940 --> 09:20.620
Let's go ahead and hide the bones.

09:20.630 --> 09:23.770
So let's shift click this layer too.

09:24.030 --> 09:24.750
And there we go.

09:25.470 --> 09:25.770
All right.

09:25.770 --> 09:27.770
So I think everything is in place.

09:27.780 --> 09:31.960
Now we've got the grease pencil object the face.

09:31.980 --> 09:33.130
Idle object.

09:33.330 --> 09:40.990
All parents to the head bone our timelines sync up and our 2D view all cleaned up as well.

09:41.100 --> 09:46.290
So in the next video what let's do is begin drawing out the face of the character.
