WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:03.180
Now let's animate the head turning back and forth.

00:03.180 --> 00:10.020
So if we select that head control up here we can see we've got a key frame on that right down here right

00:10.020 --> 00:10.900
there.

00:10.920 --> 00:16.020
So what let's do is maybe write about here.

00:16.210 --> 00:20.650
Let's have them begin turning and maybe looking to the left.

00:20.710 --> 00:24.560
So let's go ahead and add a key frame here.

00:24.600 --> 00:28.860
I'll press eye and choose location and rotation.

00:28.930 --> 00:29.410
There we go.

00:29.410 --> 00:31.940
So you can see it's been placed there.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.560
Now let's move forward and let's turn the head.

00:34.570 --> 00:42.720
So if we select that again I'm going to hit the R key two times and I'm going to just turn them like

00:42.810 --> 00:46.800
this maybe all r and turn it back like that.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.790
So he's just kind of taking a look around.

00:48.810 --> 00:51.900
It's kind of that maybe a little quick.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.850
Let me grab this one here.

00:53.850 --> 00:57.720
Just this key frame and kind of move it back some.

00:57.780 --> 00:58.860
Let's try this.

00:58.860 --> 01:03.220
I'm going to hit the spacebar and we go.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.050
Yeah I think that was a good turn.

01:05.050 --> 01:07.260
Notice that it snapped back.

01:07.270 --> 01:10.750
And that's because we have this key frame here still.

01:10.750 --> 01:14.460
So it just kind of snapped back between here and here.

01:14.470 --> 01:16.520
Let's go ahead and delete this one.

01:16.660 --> 01:19.980
I'll hit delete and delete key frames.

01:19.990 --> 01:21.330
Now let's take a look at this.

01:21.340 --> 01:29.560
If we hit the spacebar again I'll turn and I'll begin turning back because we have this key frame here

01:29.680 --> 01:37.210
as well so we could get rid of this key frame this key frame and this key frame we want to keep these

01:37.210 --> 01:38.830
at the beginning in the end.

01:38.830 --> 01:39.160
Right.

01:39.160 --> 01:45.100
So we have the exact same position at the beginning and the end of the cycle but we could delete these.

01:45.130 --> 01:47.680
So let's hit X and delete.

01:47.710 --> 01:56.230
Now it's come back here and hit the spacebar again he turns maybe a little too quick me grab that key

01:56.230 --> 01:59.980
frame hit the G key and move it out some like that.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.940
All right let's try it again.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.440
It play returns.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.250
OK maybe a little bit too slow.

02:07.250 --> 02:10.800
So now he's going to come back to the other side here.

02:10.810 --> 02:18.520
But we want him to hold just a moment as he looks this way so I want to take this key frame and duplicate

02:18.520 --> 02:18.630
it.

02:18.640 --> 02:23.550
So he holds it a bit shifty and move this out like that.

02:23.590 --> 02:31.570
Let's try this spacebar looks old now it's going to turn OK.

02:31.700 --> 02:39.130
So now we want him to kind of turn from here if he wants to turn over to the right side.

02:39.140 --> 02:42.450
So I'll grab that head bone at the Aki.

02:42.640 --> 02:48.380
I'll hit it two times and kind of rotate around like this at the Aki again and kind of move it back

02:48.380 --> 02:50.620
like that yeah.

02:50.630 --> 02:53.600
So he kind of turns that way now.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.230
All right.

02:54.410 --> 03:06.100
Shift left arrow hit that spacebar he turns he turns OK and now he's got to come back to his original

03:06.100 --> 03:07.430
position here.

03:07.510 --> 03:15.040
So we need to take this key frame right here just select this one duplicate it with shifty and let's

03:15.040 --> 03:29.120
move it over here now let's try it again shift left arrow spacebar turns it turned it turns back and

03:29.390 --> 03:40.390
we go all right now I'm going to go ahead and hit control s and save here now what let's do is let's

03:40.390 --> 03:49.390
work on the 2D base animation while he's doing is idle and looking around so really all I want is just

03:49.390 --> 03:58.150
him to kind of blink and maybe move an eyebrow up or down as he looks around so I want him to blink

03:58.390 --> 04:06.400
a couple of times in here let's say I want him to blink Oh right in here and again there.

04:06.410 --> 04:08.740
So maybe only two times.

04:08.840 --> 04:15.260
But to do that we're gonna need to draw a new stroke for the closed eyes.

04:15.260 --> 04:19.220
Which means we're going to need to access that grease pencil object again.

04:19.220 --> 04:28.170
So let's go back from Poe's mode to object mode select that grease pencil face object come back over

04:28.170 --> 04:29.840
to draw.

04:29.940 --> 04:31.020
And here we go.

04:31.020 --> 04:37.860
Now over here in our layers we're gonna need to add a blink layer as well.

04:37.860 --> 04:44.830
Let's come over here and hit the plus button and we go and we'll call this link.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.060
How's that.

04:46.060 --> 04:48.540
Well it looks like we lost the mouth.

04:48.540 --> 04:50.200
Yeah we've got some.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.770
There we go I just had to click to get it back.

04:52.920 --> 04:58.560
I'm a press control asked just to make sure we don't lose anything now for the eyes.

04:58.560 --> 05:06.310
What I'd like to do is just draw a little curve right here so that it looks like he's blinking to do

05:06.310 --> 05:15.520
that I think I'll maybe take the radius down to three and let's use this arc again here and what I'll

05:15.520 --> 05:20.200
do is I'm just going to click with this blink layer still selected.

05:20.200 --> 05:28.010
I'm just going to click and drag this way like this and let's kind of get it.

05:28.110 --> 05:31.540
Let me move this up a bit something like this.

05:31.570 --> 05:33.240
Let's see how this works.

05:34.650 --> 05:36.170
And I'll hit enter.

05:36.170 --> 05:42.920
I need to select that let me turn the eyes off over here so you can see it there and I'll tab into edit

05:42.920 --> 05:46.220
mode and hit the B key and border selected.

05:46.240 --> 05:51.200
I may just try and move it around maybe turn into a bit like this.

05:51.200 --> 05:51.460
All right.

05:51.470 --> 05:54.200
So let's bring those eyes back.

05:54.350 --> 05:55.010
How we doing.

05:55.070 --> 05:55.340
Yeah.

05:55.370 --> 06:01.810
So I kind of want them to be right there right kind of at the bottom of the eye.

06:01.930 --> 06:06.520
That may be too big Let me hit the esky and scale it down a bit.

06:06.520 --> 06:14.300
Kind of move it up into here something like that and then let's press shift D enter and I'm just gonna

06:14.320 --> 06:19.740
drag it straight over here like this that we go.

06:19.740 --> 06:30.790
So now if I turn the eyes on and off was it kind of look like he's blinking.

06:31.530 --> 06:40.010
Kind of does I think if you look at him over here in the 3D view it kind of kind of kind of does OK.

06:40.100 --> 06:48.740
So what we need to do is at particular points in the cycle we need to turn the blink on and turn the

06:48.740 --> 06:49.660
eyes off.

06:50.030 --> 06:57.260
So we're actually going to animate the visibility of the layers here and we're gonna see those key frames

06:57.620 --> 06:59.050
down in the dope sheet.

06:59.060 --> 07:04.140
We won't actually see them here in the grease pencil timeline so let's give it a try.

07:04.150 --> 07:07.130
I want to actually take this and kind of move it up a bit.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.640
So we have a bit more room down here.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.050
So where do we want these to be.

07:12.050 --> 07:18.690
Well I think we probably I kind of want the blink to happen just before the turn.

07:18.690 --> 07:22.020
We tend to blink our eyes as we're turning our head.

07:22.200 --> 07:26.670
I think maybe right in here I'd like it to begin right about there.

07:26.670 --> 07:28.500
So that's frame 35.

07:28.530 --> 07:34.890
OK let's add a key frame back here frame one to hold it.

07:34.890 --> 07:42.570
So for the eyes I'll select the eyes and I'll right click on the eyeball and choose Insert key frame

07:42.570 --> 07:45.990
right here and you can see that pop in down here.

07:45.990 --> 07:50.160
Let me scroll the armature key frames up so we can see these.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.090
So there's that eye's channel right there right.

07:53.130 --> 07:57.720
In addition we need to create a key frame for the blink with it off.

07:57.720 --> 08:02.760
So let's right click on the eye and choose Insert key frame and there we go there's our eyes and our

08:02.760 --> 08:03.210
blink.

08:03.240 --> 08:07.240
Now I said frame thirty five let's come up to here.

08:07.350 --> 08:09.210
Do I want the blink to begin here.

08:09.210 --> 08:10.130
I guess I do.

08:10.150 --> 08:12.920
So I'm going to go back to frame 34.

08:13.110 --> 08:19.910
And here is where I'm going to duplicate these key frames as well so I mean deselect everything.

08:19.920 --> 08:25.710
And I'm going to select these two key frames and I'm going to duplicate these with shift D and move

08:25.710 --> 08:32.460
them over drop them they're move forward one frame to frame 35.

08:32.540 --> 08:42.860
And now what I'm gonna do is turn the blink on and the eyes off and with auto key framing selected we

08:42.860 --> 08:45.240
get our key frames automatically there.

08:45.250 --> 08:52.320
I'm going to kind of zoom in scrolling the middle mouse button and I'll move that over here OK so there

08:52.320 --> 08:54.690
we have our blink.

08:54.690 --> 09:00.900
Now let me deselect everything with alt A and I want to select these two key frames right here and I'm

09:00.900 --> 09:07.860
going to duplicate them and move them down to key frames or two frames shifty.

09:08.010 --> 09:10.990
There's one frame two frames right there.

09:11.010 --> 09:15.180
So what I'm gonna do is have a one frame I close.

09:15.180 --> 09:22.370
They're going to be close for two frames and then a one frame I open so deselect everything.

09:22.530 --> 09:29.310
Select these two key frames again and I'm going to duplicate them and put them over here shift D move

09:29.310 --> 09:30.530
them over here.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.220
Now we go.

09:32.400 --> 09:36.960
So now as I said we've got a one frame I close.

09:36.980 --> 09:38.220
There it is.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.950
Two frames closed one frame.

09:40.950 --> 09:42.210
I open.

09:42.270 --> 09:43.530
Let's see how it looks.

09:44.940 --> 09:45.750
Yeah.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.160
Well did you see that.

09:47.310 --> 09:48.950
Or did you blink.

09:48.990 --> 09:50.710
Let's try it again.

09:50.820 --> 09:57.440
Shift left arrow spacebar Yeah well it looks OK.

09:57.450 --> 09:58.270
Let's try that again.

09:58.980 --> 10:05.960
Yeah so now that we've established these blinks what we can do is just duplicate them wherever else

10:05.990 --> 10:06.630
we want them.

10:07.100 --> 10:12.590
So if we hit play again I'll duplicate them again maybe as he's turning here.

10:12.590 --> 10:14.610
Let's try that.

10:14.670 --> 10:21.970
Deselect everything in the timeline hit the be key border select these and then let's just hit shifty.

10:22.190 --> 10:24.010
Move them down here.

10:24.010 --> 10:24.750
There we go.

10:24.790 --> 10:31.270
But let's try this a d deselect shift left arrow to go back to the beginning.

10:31.460 --> 10:42.000
Hit the spacebar he blinks there he blinks there you think we need one more over here let's try it grab

10:42.030 --> 10:49.020
those shifty and move him down yeah move him to here.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.870
Okay let's try this again.

10:52.130 --> 10:54.760
Go back to the beginning spacebar.

10:54.760 --> 10:59.970
He blinks he blinks again you blinks again OK.

10:59.980 --> 11:02.990
I think these are a little bit too late.

11:03.140 --> 11:09.530
Let's set the B key and I just want to hit G and move these back some maybe two about there.

11:09.770 --> 11:10.520
Let's try this

11:17.140 --> 11:18.020
link.

11:18.370 --> 11:19.540
Yeah.

11:19.760 --> 11:23.460
Why not.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.600
All right good.

11:26.610 --> 11:35.100
Now one last thing I want to do here is I'd like to move the endpoint of the cycle from 144 to 143 and

11:35.100 --> 11:36.850
why do I want to do that.

11:36.870 --> 11:41.880
Well currently the way it is we've got this frame happening two times.

11:41.880 --> 11:49.850
So this pose at the very end on 144 is exactly the same as this pose on frame one.

11:49.890 --> 11:52.050
And we don't need that happening twice.

11:52.050 --> 11:58.260
So what I'm to do is just shrink the timeline one frame to 143 and hit enter.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.000
Now let's see how it works.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.630
I'll hit the spacebar again and then we go

12:08.340 --> 12:15.950
yeah I think that's a pretty smooth transition between the end and the beginning all right.

12:15.980 --> 12:17.690
I think that's looking pretty good.

12:17.720 --> 12:25.550
So in the next video what let's do is let's go ahead and render out the 2D face animation to an image

12:25.550 --> 12:31.780
sequence and what we'll do then is we'll bring it back in and apply it to the Geo face.

12:31.790 --> 12:40.730
Idle object and if that works out all right then what we can do is begin creating new face objects will

12:40.910 --> 12:50.960
duplicate the geo face idle for a geo base run geo face jump and we'll do the animations for those as

12:50.960 --> 12:51.290
well.
