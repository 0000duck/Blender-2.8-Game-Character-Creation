WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:06.960
Before I begin the run animation I'd like to get rid of all these key frames and the reason why is I

00:06.960 --> 00:12.350
like to work between one and whatever I like to have the beginning of my animation or my animation that

00:12.380 --> 00:14.510
cycle begin at frame one.

00:14.570 --> 00:16.590
It's just easier for me to think about.

00:16.710 --> 00:21.390
So I want to preserve this so I can export this out to unity.

00:21.390 --> 00:29.160
I've been saving versions as we go we're here on version 42 now but I also want to be able to come back

00:29.160 --> 00:30.840
to it easily and find it.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.020
So what am I to do.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.790
So I'm going to make a copy of this.

00:33.780 --> 00:40.770
I'm gonna go to a file save copy and then I'm going to go to my exports folder here and I'll we'll call

00:40.770 --> 00:50.060
this player underscore or idle we'll just call it that so I know that when I'm ready to export the FBI

00:50.060 --> 00:56.650
works for the idle animation out to unity I can come back to this blend file and get it done.

00:56.700 --> 01:04.740
So I'm just going to choose save me and since I've chosen to make a copy I'm still here in my original

01:04.800 --> 01:06.960
number 42 blend file here.

01:06.960 --> 01:13.240
So if I would have chosen save as I would have reverted to that new file.

01:13.390 --> 01:18.000
But as it is I'm still here in the same file now that we've done that.

01:18.210 --> 01:22.300
I think what I want to do is pretty much delete all of this.

01:22.740 --> 01:26.120
So once again be sure you're saving inversions.

01:26.130 --> 01:32.280
And be sure you save a copy of what you've just done here because we're going to need that to export

01:32.280 --> 01:33.430
to unity.

01:33.450 --> 01:33.780
All right.

01:33.810 --> 01:41.730
So what I'm to do down here is I'm just gonna hit the a key and I'll hit delete and delete key frames.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.860
Now if you want to keep anything from this.

01:43.860 --> 01:50.910
Like if you want to keep say the eye blinks or something like that be sure and do that.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.510
Go ahead and only select the other key frames.

01:53.520 --> 01:59.840
But for me I'm not going to need an eye blink for the run we're gonna do a six frame run.

01:59.910 --> 02:02.580
If he blinks it's kind of look very strange.

02:02.580 --> 02:09.090
So I don't need a blink for the run animation so I'm just going to select everything it delete and delete

02:09.120 --> 02:09.900
key frames.

02:10.050 --> 02:15.050
And then we go up here in the grease pencil.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.060
I think I'm going to keep all of these for now.

02:18.060 --> 02:20.940
So let's come up here and select the rig.

02:20.940 --> 02:24.320
Let's go to pose mode.

02:24.420 --> 02:26.980
I'm going to go ahead and hit the A key just like everything.

02:27.030 --> 02:35.640
And then I want to press Alt are all G and that will get him back to his original pose there.

02:35.640 --> 02:41.280
So as I said the run cycle is only going to be about six or seven frames so we could probably change

02:41.310 --> 02:46.230
our playback range from hundred and forty three frames.

02:46.230 --> 02:49.700
Let's just choose 13 frames.

02:49.770 --> 02:59.610
Let's do that and let's go ahead and get him blocked out in 3D before we begin changing the 2D face.

02:59.610 --> 03:05.850
I think for the 2D face I'm going to turn the eyebrows down and have them be kind of angry and determined

03:06.120 --> 03:06.980
while he runs.

03:07.230 --> 03:10.400
But for now this is fine.

03:10.470 --> 03:18.630
So I think what I'll do is begin say on the right side here and what I'm gonna do is pose him for that

03:18.810 --> 03:27.120
first frame of the run cycle and to do that I think first of all this leg here should probably come

03:27.180 --> 03:28.550
out a bit.

03:28.980 --> 03:36.840
Maybe I'll even bring this down some let me bring this down like this kind of a squat there and then

03:36.930 --> 03:46.310
this leg the left leg should probably come out and I'll turn it up like this it kind of stretches out

03:46.310 --> 03:57.400
like that something like that and the other leg or the right leg should probably rotate like this and

03:57.400 --> 04:03.800
I'll bring it up and back kind of like this again.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.680
Let's see how that's working.

04:05.710 --> 04:16.890
Okay I'll take this hips or root bone and turn it forward a bit we could turn any one of these forward

04:16.890 --> 04:17.180
a bit.

04:17.190 --> 04:20.190
I'll hit arm and turn that over to bet.

04:20.490 --> 04:24.010
The head should probably look up like that.

04:24.090 --> 04:29.810
So you can see where he's going and then we will adjust the arms.

04:29.810 --> 04:37.640
Now the arms are always going to be the opposite of the legs so if we're dealing with this arm it's

04:37.640 --> 04:40.430
gonna be the opposite of the same leg.

04:40.430 --> 04:49.020
So I'll bring that down and since this leg is forward then that means this arm should be back right.

04:49.120 --> 04:57.730
Press Control three to spin around to the other side and let's select the upper arm.

04:57.730 --> 05:06.210
Oh let me go to the front view here instead and bring this down and then maybe I'll bring it forward

05:06.210 --> 05:07.220
like this.

05:07.230 --> 05:10.030
There we go let's try this

05:17.870 --> 05:18.440
okay.

05:18.460 --> 05:22.320
So we've got him kind of in that beginning pose.

05:22.330 --> 05:23.410
That's good.

05:23.410 --> 05:29.950
Now just like we did before that beginning pose is gonna have to be at the very end as well.

05:29.950 --> 05:36.310
So with all of these selected I'll go ahead and hit a and I'll press shift D and let's bring this all

05:36.310 --> 05:37.600
the way down to twelve here.

05:37.630 --> 05:38.700
Let's do that.

05:38.700 --> 05:41.820
Let me change that endpoint to twelve.

05:42.020 --> 05:43.390
There we go.

05:43.390 --> 05:51.300
Now we need to go to frame seven and we basically need to do the opposite of what we have here.

05:51.340 --> 05:57.570
So if this leg is out here then this leg needs to be out there.

05:57.760 --> 06:05.050
Now we can try to use the paste and flip feature of blender but with a character like this it might

06:05.050 --> 06:07.520
not work real well but we can try it.

06:07.930 --> 06:17.740
Let me select this and this and we moved this and this let's give this a try and see.

06:17.820 --> 06:26.210
So if we copy these if we went to key copy key frames back flip back on frame one.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.810
Let's let's do that.

06:27.810 --> 06:29.660
Let's go to Key.

06:29.670 --> 06:30.050
Copy.

06:30.050 --> 06:38.870
Key frames then if we go to frame 7 we could say key paste flipped key frames.

06:38.910 --> 06:46.960
And my guess is this isn't going to work for this character and my guess is correct.

06:47.540 --> 06:50.680
So yeah that's not going to work here.

06:50.690 --> 06:53.420
So we need to do that manually.

06:53.420 --> 06:55.590
So let's go ahead and give it a try.

06:55.610 --> 06:56.800
It isn't that hard.

06:56.840 --> 07:05.900
I'm going to take this but here and move it forward rotate it and kind of get it up where this foot

07:05.900 --> 07:07.190
is like this.

07:12.170 --> 07:20.460
And then I'm going to take this foot and move it back rotate it and put it back about where that one

07:20.460 --> 07:23.740
was as well about like that.

07:23.880 --> 07:24.390
Let's see.

07:24.410 --> 07:25.980
I'm going to click over here.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.700
And then click back.

07:28.780 --> 07:33.300
Yeah you can see a little bit of movement there but not bad.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.670
So maybe this could come up a bit.

07:37.790 --> 07:41.870
And maybe this could come down a bit like this.

07:41.870 --> 07:49.190
So I'm just clicking on frame one with the right mouse button and then on frame 7 just to see how they

07:49.190 --> 07:50.280
match up.

07:50.450 --> 07:52.450
All right that looks pretty good.

07:52.460 --> 07:59.450
Let's take on frame 7 let's take the right arm and I'm going to hit the arc key and spin it up like

07:59.450 --> 08:00.160
this.

08:01.330 --> 08:04.190
And we go and then I want to take this one

08:07.100 --> 08:11.750
and spin it back like this and let's see how we did.

08:11.860 --> 08:15.390
One frame seven.

08:15.450 --> 08:16.140
Not bad.

08:16.140 --> 08:19.340
Let me rotate this down just a hair like this.

08:19.340 --> 08:20.020
Yeah.

08:20.160 --> 08:28.430
So as I click between 1 and 7 you can see there's minimal movement here yeah.

08:28.580 --> 08:29.440
That's good.

08:29.450 --> 08:36.750
And then on frame twelve we have that original key frame original key set.

08:36.830 --> 08:41.200
OK so now if we hit play this is what we get.

08:41.540 --> 08:41.810
Right.

08:41.810 --> 08:48.230
A very basic run but I think we can do a little bit more than this so let's give it a try.

08:48.230 --> 08:55.260
Let's go back to frame two here and on frame two he kind of needs to come down on the ground.

08:55.260 --> 08:58.570
He needs to kind of hit the ground flat footed.

08:58.710 --> 09:01.860
The weight of the character needs to come down.

09:02.010 --> 09:04.680
Go to the side view.

09:04.680 --> 09:11.720
And so as I said the weight of the character should come down the foot here.

09:11.740 --> 09:18.420
Let's press Alt are and then let's press all G and get that back on the ground and then let's slide

09:18.420 --> 09:19.670
that forward right there.

09:19.670 --> 09:28.440
So you see how he's kind of bringing that foot down flat on the ground if we go back to frame one.

09:28.560 --> 09:33.160
This is kind of what we get here all right.

09:33.250 --> 09:40.780
And then this foot here isn't too bad but I think it should come forward maybe even.

09:40.790 --> 09:44.990
Uh we could kind of go like that.

09:44.990 --> 09:45.680
Let's try that.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.710
Let's go back to frame one.

09:47.840 --> 09:54.950
So you see how they're kind of moving closer together the two feet or moving closer together as he comes

09:55.340 --> 09:59.430
down and puts the weight of the body on the foot here.

09:59.450 --> 10:06.580
That now the arms should probably swing in just a bit.

10:06.610 --> 10:11.560
So from here we should probably have him bring the arm down like this.

10:11.680 --> 10:17.590
And on the other side control three maybe he should bring the arms in just a bit like this.

10:17.590 --> 10:17.850
All right.

10:17.860 --> 10:22.420
So let's see how that works like that.

10:22.440 --> 10:22.730
Yeah.

10:22.740 --> 10:29.070
He kind of hits the ground now he might be able to come down a little bit more probably not too much

10:32.950 --> 10:36.420
but this is really what they call the down position.

10:36.430 --> 10:43.510
He should be at his lowest point here on frame to go.

10:43.760 --> 10:48.170
All right let's go quickly do that over here on frame eight.

10:48.290 --> 10:51.110
We need to do the same thing.

10:51.110 --> 10:55.540
So here we have him with that foot here.

10:55.550 --> 10:56.390
All right.

10:56.390 --> 11:01.630
We need to hear we need to take that same foot and put it flat on the ground.

11:01.640 --> 11:03.580
All are all G.

11:03.800 --> 11:09.920
Slide it forward a bit and then we'll take this foot and move it forward just a little bit like that

11:11.340 --> 11:14.070
we'll do the same things with the arms.

11:14.130 --> 11:21.670
Them down a bit control our control three excuse me and move this in a bit.

11:21.670 --> 11:23.100
Let's see how that works.

11:24.280 --> 11:24.750
OK.

11:24.770 --> 11:30.910
Yeah so we've got frame to frame eight.

11:30.930 --> 11:33.160
Oh we need to bring this down.

11:34.010 --> 11:35.430
You're like this.

11:35.430 --> 11:40.670
Bring that down frame eight frame to eight.

11:40.680 --> 11:43.210
That's a little bit too far.

11:43.430 --> 11:43.850
All right.

11:43.860 --> 11:53.660
It looks like what I did is the the down position of the hips was Kerry carried over into my frame seven

11:53.670 --> 11:54.240
key frame.

11:54.240 --> 12:01.590
So what we need to do is we need to take the key frames I me press Alt A Down here we need to select

12:01.590 --> 12:10.070
the key frame for the hips here for the route right here and duplicate that over to here.

12:10.080 --> 12:14.810
So you can see here it is up in here he's down.

12:14.810 --> 12:17.810
He needs to be the he needs to be at the same place here.

12:17.810 --> 12:23.860
So let's take that one key frame and flip and press shift D and move that over to here.

12:23.870 --> 12:24.410
There we go.

12:24.440 --> 12:29.980
So now 1 and 7 is the same only opposite.

12:30.060 --> 12:31.160
Right.

12:31.190 --> 12:32.570
Like that.

12:32.570 --> 12:40.020
And so now two and eight should be the same only opposite as well.

12:40.040 --> 12:40.400
All right.

12:40.430 --> 12:44.670
So if we hit the spacebar that's what we have so far.

12:44.790 --> 12:51.360
He's pretty good and bad but we can do a little bit more so in the next video we will continue working

12:51.360 --> 12:52.650
on the run animation.
