WEBVTT

00:00.680 --> 00:06.860
There aren't too many programs that has the ability to do this but what I'd like to do is actually setup

00:06.920 --> 00:14.450
my screen here set up my interface so that I can animate the 3D body and the 2D face all in the same

00:14.450 --> 00:16.630
view all in the same interface.

00:16.670 --> 00:22.670
So since I'll be creating a 2D face I kind of want that 2D animation screen layout.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.490
Now we don't see it here.

00:24.560 --> 00:31.300
When you create a new scene you have the option of choosing to the animation here but it isn't.

00:31.300 --> 00:34.720
Up here in the tabs at least currently in this version.

00:34.730 --> 00:43.560
So what we can do is click on the plus here and change to 2D animation 2D animation right here so there

00:43.560 --> 00:43.850
we go.

00:43.860 --> 00:46.230
Then we've got our 2D animation interface.

00:46.230 --> 00:52.350
Now for me the first thing I'd like to do is get rid of this white background that to me is just too

00:52.350 --> 00:53.310
bright.

00:53.310 --> 00:55.620
So I'm going to choose theme here.

00:55.740 --> 01:00.270
So that helps that I'm also going to turn my looked back on.

01:00.270 --> 01:01.380
There we go.

01:01.380 --> 01:09.330
So this is our 2D animation screen layout and this is going to help us with some panels over here.

01:09.510 --> 01:15.170
But there's quite a bit of customization I want to do here before we actually get started.

01:15.180 --> 01:20.260
So the first thing I'd like to do is just come up here and grab this corner right here and drag over.

01:20.460 --> 01:27.810
So we get two windows here and in addition I'd like to grab this and move it up and then I want two

01:27.810 --> 01:28.500
windows here.

01:28.500 --> 01:35.040
So I want to grab this corner here and move it down like that to create a new window.

01:35.100 --> 01:35.350
All right.

01:35.370 --> 01:43.590
So this over here I'm just gonna tumble around here is going to be my 3D view where I can see the character

01:43.590 --> 01:44.220
in 3D.

01:44.220 --> 01:49.050
Now over here I want this to be my 2D view where I'm going to work on the face.

01:49.290 --> 01:54.480
But the problem is in the 2D view we usually do it through the camera.

01:54.480 --> 02:01.440
We usually have a camera that we're looking through and I had deleted the camera a long time ago.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.340
So let's create one here.

02:03.510 --> 02:06.480
The first thing I need to do is switch out of pose mode.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.840
So go from pose to object mode.

02:08.850 --> 02:14.140
And now that we're in object mode here I will go ahead and press shift a.

02:14.430 --> 02:17.480
And then bring in a camera.

02:17.490 --> 02:19.580
Now when I did that look at where it went.

02:19.620 --> 02:27.510
It went over here into the control objects collection right here and therefore we can't see it because

02:27.510 --> 02:29.630
that entire collection is hidden.

02:29.700 --> 02:35.190
So I'm just going to take that camera and drag it up into the main scene collection here and then we

02:35.190 --> 02:35.410
go.

02:35.410 --> 02:42.660
So now you can see we are actually looking through the camera over here and you can see that our camera

02:42.660 --> 02:45.450
is right here as well.

02:45.450 --> 02:51.960
Now if we tumble out of here and we want to get back to our camera view we can always just hit the zero

02:51.960 --> 02:56.820
key on the number pad and that will bring us back to our camera view.

02:56.850 --> 02:57.050
All right.

02:57.060 --> 03:04.870
So we need to move the camera around a bit hard so let's select a camera and let's open up this sidebar

03:05.010 --> 03:10.220
here and in here what let's do is just clear the rotations here.

03:10.230 --> 03:15.690
I'm just going to click and drag and all of those fields and type in zero and enter and that will just

03:16.080 --> 03:18.520
turn the camera straight down.

03:18.540 --> 03:24.160
Now we can turn it in the X a 90 degrees and that'll pop it back up there.

03:24.180 --> 03:35.190
Now if we grab it and move it back and I want to just aim it right at the face right in here so since

03:35.190 --> 03:41.160
the face is going to be a two dimensional image is going to be a sequence of images actually we're going

03:41.160 --> 03:47.900
to render out a sequence of images and apply it to an object on the face for it to animate there.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.160
And when we apply our texture we're gonna want it to be a power of two in other words Square.

03:53.250 --> 03:58.980
We're gonna want to use textures like 10 24 or 2048 or 256.

03:58.980 --> 04:01.000
And I think that's what we want here.

04:01.140 --> 04:09.310
We're gonna want this 2D face image to be two hundred and fifty six by two fifty six.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.780
So let's come over and change that for the camera here.

04:12.780 --> 04:20.130
If we come over to the output right here we want to change this 1920 by 10 80 which is just standard

04:20.160 --> 04:22.180
HD resolution.

04:22.230 --> 04:27.060
I'm going to change this to two 56 by 256.

04:27.060 --> 04:33.450
And that is how big the texture is going to be for our our face images.

04:33.450 --> 04:39.330
Now we can scale the camera down here it's pretty big in the sea and I'll just hit s and scale down

04:39.330 --> 04:39.870
like this.

04:39.870 --> 04:45.720
Just for our view here in the 3D view it doesn't change anything it just makes the representation of

04:45.720 --> 04:47.940
it in the 3D view a little smaller.

04:48.090 --> 04:56.640
And I'll just grab this and move it so it's about I don't know it's about like this.

04:56.670 --> 04:58.950
Let's give this a try.

04:59.130 --> 05:02.470
I kind of want to get it pretty close there like that.

05:02.480 --> 05:02.850
There we go.

05:02.850 --> 05:09.420
So we're gonna work on the 2D face here in this view and as we do this we're gonna want this camera

05:09.420 --> 05:13.620
to stay put no matter how we move the character around.

05:13.620 --> 05:21.060
So if we grab say the head control up here maybe I'll go to pose mode and select that if we just move

05:21.060 --> 05:21.370
this.

05:21.390 --> 05:24.590
Currently the camera stays where it is.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.090
We want it to move with the head.

05:27.090 --> 05:32.690
So I want to parent this camera to the head bone of the character to do that.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.780
We need to enable this second layer again.

05:35.790 --> 05:38.290
So I'll just press shift and click here.

05:38.490 --> 05:46.160
And then if I come down here to this panel the object data and viewport we can choose in front again.

05:46.260 --> 05:51.270
We had turned it off previously but for now we want to enable it so we can see in here.

05:51.390 --> 05:54.650
And this is the bone we want to parent the camera to.

05:55.260 --> 05:56.160
So let's do that.

05:56.160 --> 06:04.320
Let's select the camera right here and then I'm gonna shift select this bone right here so I clicked

06:04.320 --> 06:09.810
once I shift clicked once and now I'm going to shift click again right here.

06:09.810 --> 06:17.090
Now we're going to parent the camera to the bone with control P and I'm going to choose bone.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.300
And then we go.

06:18.300 --> 06:25.260
So now if we turn this layer off right here and then select that head bone we can hit are two times

06:25.260 --> 06:26.550
again.

06:26.550 --> 06:33.330
And now you can see the camera just rolls with the head so no matter where that character goes that

06:33.330 --> 06:36.420
camera's always going to be there and that's what we want.

06:36.510 --> 06:44.760
Now we'll be able to draw and animate the 2D face here while the character is moving around in the 3D

06:44.760 --> 06:45.720
view.

06:45.720 --> 06:45.960
All right.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.390
So let's go ahead and hide that camera away now.

06:48.390 --> 06:50.890
I'll just click here to hide that.

06:51.000 --> 06:51.770
All right.

06:51.810 --> 06:57.840
Now the next thing we need to do is create an object that we're going to apply those textures to once

06:57.840 --> 07:04.130
we get into unity we're going to need an object to apply our image sequences too.

07:04.200 --> 07:10.070
So what we need to do now is come back into object mode here select our character and then we're going

07:10.070 --> 07:12.050
to tab into edit mode.

07:12.180 --> 07:19.320
And here we're going to maybe go to face select and we need to select the faces that are going to be

07:20.010 --> 07:20.550
the face.

07:20.550 --> 07:25.170
So I think all we're gonna need is just these bases here.

07:25.170 --> 07:31.350
I don't think we're gonna have the eyes spin around to the side of the head or the mouth go down below

07:31.350 --> 07:32.310
the chin or anything.

07:32.310 --> 07:37.500
So I think this is pretty much the bounds of the 2D face.

07:37.530 --> 07:40.050
So with these selected what let's do.

07:40.050 --> 07:44.260
I'm going to select the character scene collection right over here.

07:44.310 --> 07:51.210
So with these selected let's go ahead and duplicate these with shift D and enter and then I just want

07:51.210 --> 07:56.490
to pull them out just a little bit so I'll go to the my move tool here and hit the period key to zoom

07:56.490 --> 08:01.410
in and let's just pull this out just a tiny little bit.

08:01.410 --> 08:05.600
I'm just going to pull it out in the y just a smidge like that.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.120
So it's out from the mass.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.720
Just a tiny bit.

08:10.010 --> 08:15.290
And then once I've done that I want to split it out as its own object to do that.

08:15.380 --> 08:21.680
I'm going to press the p key and that will bring up the separate menu and we can choose selection.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.950
And then we go by tab back into object mode.

08:24.950 --> 08:27.920
I can select just that piece and there it is.

08:27.920 --> 08:32.280
We've got it called character 0 0 1 but that's not what we want.

08:32.330 --> 08:37.910
Let's call this something that will really help us once for in unity know what is what I think what

08:37.910 --> 08:45.030
we need to do is let's call this geometry let's call this geo base idol.

08:45.740 --> 08:47.270
Let's do that.

08:47.450 --> 08:53.540
So we know what it is and we know it's geometry as opposed to a material and that that's going to be

08:53.750 --> 08:57.760
or that can get confusing here as we go into the future.

08:57.770 --> 08:58.010
All right.

08:58.010 --> 09:04.730
So now we've got this as its own object what we should do is take away any of the modifiers that the

09:05.030 --> 09:06.540
original object had on it.

09:06.570 --> 09:12.440
If we go over to the modifiers panel here you can see we've still got that armature modifier on that

09:12.440 --> 09:13.850
face and we don't want that.

09:13.880 --> 09:21.710
So let's just delete this armature modifier from this new object we still have it here with our character

09:21.710 --> 09:23.170
we need it here.

09:23.300 --> 09:25.920
But for this we don't need it.

09:25.970 --> 09:30.220
Now what let's do is go ahead and do the same thing we did with the camera parent.

09:30.230 --> 09:35.720
This object to the headphone because we want this to move with the headphone before we do that let's

09:35.720 --> 09:39.620
make sure the origin of the object is where we want it to be.

09:39.620 --> 09:45.290
I think where I'd like it to be is right in the center of the face right here so if I go to edge mode

09:45.290 --> 09:48.620
and select that edge maybe right there would be good.

09:48.650 --> 09:57.700
Let me move the cursor with shift s cursor to selected and it looks like I may have turned off the cursor.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.770
Let me come over here to overlays.

09:59.770 --> 10:00.290
Sure enough.

10:00.310 --> 10:02.770
Let me turn on cursor there.

10:02.770 --> 10:03.440
There we go.

10:03.730 --> 10:06.430
So we can see the 3D cursor there.

10:06.460 --> 10:13.660
Now let's tap back into object mode and go to object set Origin and Origin to 3d cursor.

10:13.660 --> 10:16.210
And that will bring the origin of this object right there.

10:16.210 --> 10:17.530
That's good.

10:17.530 --> 10:18.520
Now let's parent it.

10:18.520 --> 10:24.130
Let's go back to our rig turn on that layer too.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.940
We'll go to post mode.

10:26.980 --> 10:28.470
Meet drag this over.

10:28.470 --> 10:30.650
We'll go to post mode here.

10:30.850 --> 10:36.820
Then we'll select that new object shift click the bone and once again.

10:36.880 --> 10:37.600
And there we go.

10:37.600 --> 10:41.250
Control P and parent to bone.

10:41.260 --> 10:48.880
Now if we select that object right there or that control now we can see that that object is parents

10:48.910 --> 10:50.690
to the head bone as well.

10:50.870 --> 10:51.480
And that's good.

10:51.490 --> 10:55.950
That's the object that we're going to apply the 2D images to.

10:55.990 --> 10:56.290
All right.

10:56.290 --> 10:57.480
We're making progress here.

10:57.490 --> 11:01.840
But in the next video we will continue with setting up the interface.

11:01.990 --> 11:04.900
And we need to work on these timelines down here.
