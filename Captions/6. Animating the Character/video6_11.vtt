WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:03.570
Well I'd like this guy to have a little more fun as he jumps.

00:03.570 --> 00:04.910
He looks awful grumpy here.

00:04.920 --> 00:12.240
So let's go back to object mode and Let's select that grease pencil object and then we can go over to

00:12.270 --> 00:14.070
draw mode here.

00:14.220 --> 00:22.080
Now for this I think I don't need the sad mouth here or the grumpy mouth the sneer.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.060
Let me hide that.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.500
I think I'll draw a new one.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.230
We could adjust the eyebrows a little bit better to me.

00:28.230 --> 00:37.790
Tab into edit mode and I'll hit that B key and border select and let's put the eyebrows in a more pleasing

00:38.180 --> 00:40.250
position here.

00:40.250 --> 00:41.510
Something like this.

00:41.510 --> 00:43.560
I'm just trying to find.

00:43.660 --> 00:49.980
A default pose here that's kind of in-between the smile and the frown.

00:50.180 --> 00:53.610
So something like this maybe that's the.

00:53.720 --> 01:04.070
And then for the mouth what I want is a fairly big smile like like like he's having fun.

01:04.220 --> 01:11.210
And where should that go I think that should probably go out here around frame 15.

01:11.420 --> 01:13.900
Me draw it here and then I can move it.

01:13.910 --> 01:15.750
So let's think about this.

01:15.770 --> 01:23.000
Let created a new grease pencil layer over here and I'll call this mouth.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.110
I'm going to call it mouth open because I think his mouth is gonna be open here and let's go to draw.

01:30.110 --> 01:37.790
And with that layer selected what I'm gonna do is take the arc and I want to fill it.

01:37.790 --> 01:47.600
So I'll come back to our materials here and I'll choose that black fill and I'll click and drag like

01:47.600 --> 01:54.240
this me try this or grab that handle here and pull down all right.

01:54.270 --> 01:56.860
So it's gonna be something kind of like this.

01:56.850 --> 01:57.960
I mean hit that.

01:57.960 --> 02:01.740
Let me go to edit mode and select that.

02:01.740 --> 02:06.800
And then I kind of want to turn it make it kind of like this.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.480
So you can kind of see what I'm doing here maybe.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.000
I don't know.

02:12.680 --> 02:16.800
I just want them to have kind of a a goofy grin.

02:17.910 --> 02:24.330
As he as he jumps something hit the s in the z key and I'm going to kind of make this a little bit bigger

02:25.700 --> 02:28.950
and uh something like this.

02:28.950 --> 02:30.690
Let me see let me see how this works.

02:30.790 --> 02:34.170
OK so Okay that may be a little bit too big.

02:34.170 --> 02:40.410
Hang on let me scale it down just a bit okay yeah.

02:40.430 --> 02:41.630
Something like this.

02:41.630 --> 02:48.120
I know that looks kind of cheesy but I think it's what I'm after I think it's what I'm going for here.

02:48.230 --> 02:56.670
Let me go back to draw and go to the line tool and I'm just going to click and drag across here to clean

02:56.670 --> 02:58.950
this up like that.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.170
All right let's hit enter there.

03:00.200 --> 03:00.590
OK.

03:00.620 --> 03:03.390
So that's kind of what I want.

03:05.420 --> 03:05.850
Yes.

03:05.880 --> 03:15.090
So he's kind of happy and having fun go back to edit mode and I may shrink that down just a bit

03:18.240 --> 03:21.550
let's try this yeah.

03:21.620 --> 03:22.010
OK.

03:22.010 --> 03:27.650
So now he's got kind of a goofy grin because he's flyin up in the air and having fun.

03:27.650 --> 03:30.310
And he didn't know he'd have this much fun.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.770
All of a sudden I'm creating quite a story here aren't I.

03:34.200 --> 03:34.520
OK.

03:34.550 --> 03:40.350
So what let's do is let's create a new material slot here.

03:40.370 --> 03:46.330
Let's grab that black fill and then let's duplicate it right here.

03:46.340 --> 03:46.760
There we go.

03:46.760 --> 03:55.870
So now we'll call this red bill and for the stroke it'll be a drag.

03:55.870 --> 04:00.580
Up here it'll be quite bright red right here.

04:00.620 --> 04:03.040
Something like that OK.

04:03.040 --> 04:09.430
And then for the fill I want the same color so I'm just going to grab the eyedropper and I drop that

04:09.430 --> 04:14.170
swatch there and make it the same color now that we have that.

04:14.210 --> 04:17.890
Let's go back to our draw option here.

04:17.930 --> 04:22.160
Let's go to our arc tool and let's see if we can do this.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.840
So I kind of want it to be

04:27.250 --> 04:28.870
something like this.

04:28.870 --> 04:30.560
Let's see.

04:30.900 --> 04:31.950
Let me undo that.

04:31.950 --> 04:34.260
Let me try this again.

04:34.380 --> 04:40.100
Maybe I'll reduce the pixel size to three and click and drag this way

04:43.420 --> 04:52.420
and then bring that up a bit here and then I think what I want to do is make another one going this

04:52.420 --> 04:52.720
way.

04:52.750 --> 05:01.000
So like the like that and then I'll grab this and bring it down like that.

05:01.890 --> 05:07.290
Let's see if this works I'll hit enter and we've got a little bit of a problem there.

05:07.320 --> 05:11.030
But you can see what I'm kind of going for to see that tongue in there.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.890
I'll just grab that line stroke and just draw.

05:13.890 --> 05:15.330
There we go.

05:15.330 --> 05:15.920
Enter.

05:15.930 --> 05:16.870
Okay.

05:17.100 --> 05:22.680
All right I kind of need to move all of that so I'm going to go back into edit mode and I'll just select

05:23.130 --> 05:31.260
a point here on the tongue and hit L and a point here or let me hit L then I'll shift click excuse me

05:31.260 --> 05:37.560
and hit l here and shift click here and hit l.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.410
So that should be all of that.

05:39.690 --> 05:47.520
And then I can kind of move it around a bit to maybe I want to bring it up a little bit like this let's

05:47.520 --> 05:50.030
try that tab back into object mode.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.490
So yeah you can see the tongue there.

05:53.490 --> 05:59.010
Maybe we need to see a little bit of the teeth and maybe that tongue's a little bit too big.

05:59.010 --> 06:03.610
I mean scale it down some and move it into place like this.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.910
Let's try this.

06:06.050 --> 06:08.220
Okay so there's his tongue.

06:08.320 --> 06:12.150
Let's work on the teeth now so let's do the same thing.

06:12.310 --> 06:14.890
Let's create a new material slot.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.740
Let's choose that red fill.

06:17.740 --> 06:28.760
We will duplicate it and then we'll call this white fill there and we'll change our color to plain white

06:29.730 --> 06:35.450
I mean just bring all of these down here like this and then drag this all the way up.

06:35.710 --> 06:36.400
There we go.

06:36.890 --> 06:40.700
And then we will select this Swatch.

06:40.790 --> 06:42.610
Use the eyedropper and select that.

06:42.740 --> 06:43.120
Okay.

06:43.130 --> 06:47.960
So now we have white and for this I think just a similar thing.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.480
Let me go back to the draw tool.

06:50.480 --> 07:00.080
Let's create an arc and maybe we just draw like this and then grab this and move it down a bit like

07:00.080 --> 07:09.900
that and go and then maybe just a a line across up here.

07:09.940 --> 07:21.630
So it's straight like this grab that bad up here I mean hit the tab key select this press the L key

07:22.380 --> 07:30.750
shift select that line up at the top here I mean see if I can get it and then hit the L key here as

07:30.750 --> 07:31.890
well.

07:31.890 --> 07:40.710
Now we can move this around a bit maybe shrink it down some kind of put it where we want it to be here

07:41.550 --> 07:44.620
let's try this yeah.

07:44.630 --> 07:53.730
So he's got kind of a goofy grin and then we go let's try that yeah.

07:53.760 --> 07:57.010
So something like that.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.870
I don't really like what's going on over here.

07:59.880 --> 08:13.040
I may take this right here and kind of move it out like that and we go see how that works yeah okay.

08:13.100 --> 08:21.280
I think that'll work so with this now this this right here needs to happen in the middle so it needs

08:21.280 --> 08:24.340
to happen really from here to here.

08:24.400 --> 08:33.590
So let's take that mouth open here and let's duplicate it and let's move it to here and duplicate it

08:33.590 --> 08:35.220
again and move it to here.

08:35.510 --> 08:42.190
And then what we can do is create a new mouth here so right here.

08:42.200 --> 08:50.870
Let's let's go back and back into edit mode and I'll hit the B key and since I have these key frames

08:50.870 --> 08:58.670
here right here and right here if I go into edit mode and border select this and delete it delete and

08:58.670 --> 09:00.190
delete strokes.

09:00.530 --> 09:02.080
You can see that over here.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.050
It's still here.

09:03.050 --> 09:03.320
Right.

09:03.350 --> 09:10.250
I've still got my key frames here so I've preserved it here but now it's gone here and we can create

09:10.400 --> 09:12.950
something new on this layer.

09:12.950 --> 09:19.880
So for something new let's go back to the draw tool and I'm going to use that arc again and I'm going

09:19.880 --> 09:27.700
to use a black stroke over here in the materials and I'll just kind of draw Oh that's too small.

09:27.800 --> 09:41.030
Let me change the radius back to five pixels and I will just draw a very kind of a generic mouth shape

09:41.030 --> 09:41.840
here.

09:41.930 --> 09:45.770
So it's kind of between the sneer and the smile.

09:45.800 --> 09:49.520
You know that we created earlier.

09:49.520 --> 09:49.810
All right.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.050
So something like this.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.450
So now let's see how this works.

09:52.460 --> 09:56.070
So all of a sudden he goes with a

10:00.460 --> 10:01.390
that's not too bad.

10:01.390 --> 10:06.490
The only thing we could maybe we could play with is the actual size.

10:06.520 --> 10:12.970
So let's let's duplicate this and put it right a right around frame 14.

10:12.990 --> 10:19.540
And then let's come back to this frame on frame four and what this do is let's just simply grab this

10:20.110 --> 10:23.280
and shrink it down just a bit like this.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.740
Let's see what happens.

10:24.760 --> 10:25.970
I'm curious.

10:26.230 --> 10:26.940
Let's go back.

10:26.950 --> 10:30.820
And here we go.

10:31.360 --> 10:36.180
So what we need is another key frame probably back here.

10:36.190 --> 10:37.400
Let's try this.

10:37.450 --> 10:40.600
So it opens a little a little quicker

10:44.340 --> 10:44.590
right.

10:44.620 --> 10:51.920
So you can see it kind of open a little quicker now we could actually take this.

10:51.920 --> 10:59.760
Let's try this just for fun and let's select this and let's just make it a little bigger.

11:00.050 --> 11:05.480
So let's go back to this key frame here and let's just scale that up.

11:05.660 --> 11:07.670
That was just ridiculously big.

11:07.670 --> 11:09.660
He's having a great time here.

11:09.710 --> 11:15.350
All right and then let's also take this duplicate it.

11:15.350 --> 11:16.970
Bring it out here.

11:17.120 --> 11:25.590
Then let's take this one and bring it to here and then maybe we could yeah I think that'll do it.

11:25.770 --> 11:26.180
When we go.

11:26.210 --> 11:27.550
Let's see how this works.

11:33.030 --> 11:38.240
Yeah.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.600
It's a little silly but I think it'll work.

11:41.620 --> 11:45.110
I just wanted to look like he's having a good time as he jumps also.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.810
We could go ahead and change the eyebrows as well.

11:48.910 --> 11:54.240
So for the brows here we've got it at this point here.

11:54.370 --> 12:03.760
So maybe at this point we could begin changing the eyebrows so they begin kind of going up and turning

12:03.880 --> 12:04.570
like this

12:07.950 --> 12:19.520
let's try that and then they go back down here so we'd need to get rid of this key frame here and this

12:19.520 --> 12:21.110
one as well on the brow.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.610
Eleanor so let's get rid of this right.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.470
So that holds those.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.760
And then we could have them.

12:29.060 --> 12:30.380
Let's duplicate this.

12:30.380 --> 12:40.470
Move it over to your and then we could go back and maybe grab this one duplicate this over here like

12:40.470 --> 12:44.710
that let's try this.

12:44.790 --> 12:46.830
We only got one down.

12:46.830 --> 12:56.180
Let's grab that other one here this.

12:56.200 --> 12:56.590
There we go.

12:56.620 --> 12:57.830
So let's try this.

12:57.880 --> 13:03.010
So they go up and they go down at the play

13:08.280 --> 13:11.920
maybe move this one this way

13:23.000 --> 13:24.150
there we go.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.590
All right.

13:25.640 --> 13:32.680
I think we have our jump an animation there's certainly more that we could do to play around with this

13:32.720 --> 13:35.610
but I think for now that's going to be good.

13:35.690 --> 13:46.130
So I think what we need to do now is work on exporting all of our animations our character to unity

13:47.200 --> 13:53.980
so in the next video what let's do is work on creating all the exports and taking meant unity.
