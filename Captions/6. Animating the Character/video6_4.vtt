00:00.560 --> 00:07.310
For the idol of the character I think I'm going to make it about six seconds long and if we look on

00:07.310 --> 00:14.450
our output panel over here we can see that our frame rate is currently 24 frames per second and that's

00:14.660 --> 00:15.080
fine.

00:15.110 --> 00:16.800
I'm going to leave it at that.

00:16.850 --> 00:22.590
So for six seconds of animation at 24 frames per second that would be 144.

00:22.610 --> 00:23.570
Right.

00:23.600 --> 00:28.850
So let's come over here and type in 144 down here.

00:28.850 --> 00:33.670
Now we have a timeline of 144 frames.

00:33.830 --> 00:37.520
Let's go ahead and begin getting him in his first pose.

00:37.520 --> 00:43.130
So maybe if I go to the front view here I'm just going to select one of the arms and I'll hit AR and

00:43.310 --> 00:44.720
turn it down like this.

00:44.720 --> 00:50.670
And keep in mind I'm here on frame one and what I should do actually let me undo that.

00:50.670 --> 00:57.830
I'm like press Alt are what I should do first of all is turn on the automatic key frame insertion.

00:57.950 --> 00:59.540
So let's click this.

00:59.540 --> 01:06.110
And now if we do anything to the rig if I hit R and pull this down to say right here you can see we

01:06.110 --> 01:09.170
get our key frames automatically inserted.

01:09.170 --> 01:15.530
We could do it manually by pushing the eye key and choosing location and rotation.

01:15.530 --> 01:19.670
And that would be fine if you want to do it manually each time.

01:19.670 --> 01:24.560
But I think it goes a little quicker if you have blender do it automatically.

01:24.560 --> 01:34.100
So I'm just going to hit R and rotate this down and that'll be our beginning pose for the arms for this

01:34.100 --> 01:42.950
for The Root bone or the hips maybe I'd like to move this down just a bit here kind of bend the legs

01:42.950 --> 01:51.640
just a bit like this and I may I may turn these a bit too I'll hit the three key If I select this control

01:51.640 --> 01:59.410
the spine to and hit ah I can turn it just a bit and maybe I'll turn this one just a bit that spine

01:59.410 --> 02:05.400
one I'm in hit ah and turn them over just a little bit just to give him some room to kind of breathe

02:05.400 --> 02:05.690
in.

02:05.690 --> 02:12.230
So what I'm going to do is kind of have him breathe in and the arms come out of it and then then relax

02:12.830 --> 02:17.110
and do that a few times over the period of six seconds okay.

02:17.140 --> 02:18.840
So we've got this.

02:18.880 --> 02:26.230
What we're gonna need is all of this to be duplicated back over here at the end of our cycle because

02:26.230 --> 02:32.110
we need the first frame of the cycle and the last frame of the cycle to be exactly the same.

02:32.710 --> 02:39.450
So to do that I'm just going to WITH ALL THESE still selected I'm going to press shift D and just move

02:39.450 --> 02:42.900
them all the way down here like that.

02:42.940 --> 02:48.650
Okay now I'm not really sure how many times he's gonna take a breath here.

02:48.760 --> 02:54.910
Let's see if I right click on the timeline and click and drag with the right mouse button.

02:54.940 --> 03:01.110
I can move this timeline cursor to where I wanted to be so I was on frame 1.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.720
Let's move it up to.

03:03.730 --> 03:04.240
I don't know.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.980
I don't know how long a breath should take.

03:05.980 --> 03:08.170
Let's try 20 frames.

03:08.170 --> 03:15.760
So what I'll do here is select that hips control and let's move it back to where it was I'll press all

03:15.820 --> 03:22.180
G and that will move it back up to where it was and when we do that that will also create key frames.

03:22.180 --> 03:27.800
So if I right click and drag you can see he's going from down here up to here.

03:27.910 --> 03:36.010
See him kind of moving up and down at frame 20 as well I think maybe I will go ahead and take these

03:36.100 --> 03:40.950
and I'll press Alt R to bring them back up to where they were.

03:40.970 --> 03:41.340
All right.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.820
So he's gonna kind of maybe take a breath.

03:44.860 --> 03:48.370
You see how he's kind of taking a breath.

03:48.370 --> 03:54.550
You have to make the sound effects you know so we can just taken a breath there.

03:54.590 --> 03:56.620
OK.

03:56.810 --> 04:03.980
In addition I think I want that head bone too or that head control the head to kind of move forward

04:03.980 --> 04:05.190
a bit.

04:05.240 --> 04:12.910
So if we come over here and let's choose this head bone I'm going to insert a key frame here at the

04:12.910 --> 04:19.990
Iki location and rotation I'm doing that because I need to add a key frame but I'm not changing anything

04:20.470 --> 04:20.790
right.

04:21.100 --> 04:27.400
So now if I move this up to here now I think what I'd like to do is roll this forward just a bit so

04:27.400 --> 04:33.080
I'll hit the R key and rotate it forward just a tiny little bit like that.

04:33.100 --> 04:33.400
All right.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.750
So let's see how that works.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.130
Let's see what that looks like.

04:37.250 --> 04:44.320
That we begin down here he kind of goes up and down so that may be a bit too much.

04:44.490 --> 04:45.560
Let's give it a try.

04:45.560 --> 04:49.320
That may be OK let's try it.

04:49.440 --> 04:59.390
So what I want to do is take these key frames here oh let me do the arms and let me do the arms so I

04:59.390 --> 05:06.170
think what I'll do is for the arms I want to move these out just a bit so I'll hit the Aki and move

05:06.170 --> 05:11.450
them out just a smidge and then the Aki and move this out just a smidge.

05:11.450 --> 05:12.110
There we go.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.900
Now let's see how that works.

05:14.940 --> 05:15.310
Yeah.

05:15.320 --> 05:18.250
Kind of goes like that.

05:18.470 --> 05:18.800
OK.

05:18.830 --> 05:23.750
So we don't really know how the timing is on this we're going to have to get some other key frames in

05:23.750 --> 05:25.790
here to know what the timing is.

05:26.420 --> 05:33.680
So what let's do is I'm going to press all a down here to deselect everything and then I'll press the

05:33.680 --> 05:38.870
B key and border select all of these and then I'll duplicate these.

05:38.880 --> 05:46.070
So shift D and then I'll just drag this way and I don't know how long at this point in time maybe 15

05:46.070 --> 05:50.680
frames to frame thirty five let's say and then let's do the same thing over here.

05:50.690 --> 05:57.250
I'm going to border select all of these and press shift D and move these over to here.

05:57.260 --> 06:00.840
So now let's see how this works.

06:01.070 --> 06:06.160
I'm going to go back to the beginning of the timeline with shift left arrow.

06:06.160 --> 06:06.830
Here we go.

06:06.890 --> 06:12.260
And then I'm going to hit the spacebar.

06:12.340 --> 06:13.450
OK.

06:13.810 --> 06:15.880
So the timing on that isn't quite right.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.220
A little bit too slow on everything.

06:18.530 --> 06:22.510
OK so let's deselect with all a.

06:22.510 --> 06:26.300
Oh I need to do all day over here in the timeline.

06:26.410 --> 06:30.240
I'll hit the B key and let's border select these G.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.000
Move them in some.

06:32.290 --> 06:35.130
And then let's do this.

06:35.560 --> 06:39.670
I may not need extra frames here but let's try it.

06:39.760 --> 06:45.460
I'm going to take these and border select borders like these and hit the G key and move these back to

06:45.460 --> 06:46.600
here.

06:46.600 --> 06:54.860
So let's try this go back to the beginning with shift and left arrow and play Yeah see I don't think

06:54.860 --> 07:01.340
I need this here to hold that so I'm going to hit B and border select and just delete these hit the

07:01.340 --> 07:04.810
delete key and choose Delete key frames.

07:04.820 --> 07:14.980
So now what let's do is let's put these on frame 15 and then let's put these on frame 30.

07:14.990 --> 07:18.050
I'll hit the G key and move these to frame 30.

07:18.050 --> 07:27.510
Now let's try this shift left arrow and let's hit the spacebar seems to be a little bit too fast.

07:27.560 --> 07:28.230
All right.

07:28.370 --> 07:29.660
We're getting there though.

07:29.810 --> 07:32.140
I will move these out to frame 20.

07:32.140 --> 07:40.730
Then let's try that old aide de select B two border select g to move and let's move these two frame

07:41.060 --> 07:48.360
forty shift and left arrow and hit the spacebar yeah let's try that.

07:48.390 --> 07:48.710
OK.

07:48.720 --> 07:53.940
So now what let's do is go ahead and do this throughout the whole thing.

07:54.030 --> 07:58.530
So let's take these two rows of key frames.

07:58.560 --> 08:06.810
I'll press the B key and let's grab these and so let's press shift D duplicate these and move these

08:06.900 --> 08:10.030
out to frame 60.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.390
Let's do that.

08:11.420 --> 08:12.360
All right click.

08:12.360 --> 08:16.740
Move it down to one frame one hit the spacebar

08:19.750 --> 08:20.870
a little bit too much.

08:20.870 --> 08:22.640
He's moving a little bit too much.

08:23.030 --> 08:28.910
But let's go ahead and get this all timed out.

08:28.910 --> 08:37.970
So once again let's take these to be key border select these two rows shift deep and move these down

08:38.140 --> 08:40.660
to well one hundred.

08:40.670 --> 08:46.040
Let's try that shift and left arrow key and then let's hit the spacebar

08:51.570 --> 08:52.140
All right.

08:52.140 --> 08:59.100
I think what we could do is slow it down some and move this row here

09:01.890 --> 09:03.380
to the very end.

09:03.390 --> 09:11.610
Let's try this one I'm going to do is border select these and delete them and we go now I'm going to

09:11.610 --> 09:18.420
select everything here hit the a key and let's move this cursor all the way back to frame one and then

09:18.420 --> 09:25.400
if we hit the esky and scale these it will scale from the point of the timeline cursor here.

09:26.130 --> 09:33.360
So will this do is just hit the esky and scale these out until that last column of key frames is right

09:33.360 --> 09:36.180
at the end at one forty 44.

09:36.180 --> 09:37.410
All right let's try this

09:43.790 --> 09:47.210
all right.

09:47.240 --> 09:47.670
OK.

09:47.690 --> 09:49.740
I will go with that for now.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.400
That's OK.

09:52.400 --> 09:57.600
It's not great but I think that'll work for now.

09:57.620 --> 09:58.100
All right.

09:58.730 --> 10:06.620
So now that we've got him kind of breathing in an idle cycle there in the next video let's work on moving

10:06.620 --> 10:08.300
the head back and forth.

10:08.300 --> 10:14.920
Let's turn the head one way so he can look to the side and then look back and then back to the center

10:14.930 --> 10:16.890
before the end of the cycle.

10:17.060 --> 10:18.300
That's coming up next.
