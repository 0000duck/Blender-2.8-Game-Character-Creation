00:00.540 --> 00:06.480
To begin using the grease pencil to draw our 2D face we need to first switch over to object mode so

00:06.480 --> 00:09.540
we can select that GP base object.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.460
Let's do that now.

00:11.610 --> 00:16.110
With that grease pencil objects selected we can switch from object mode to draw mode.

00:16.110 --> 00:16.900
Here we go.

00:17.190 --> 00:20.220
And we've got these new tools now to draw.

00:20.220 --> 00:26.970
We need to create a new layer so let's come over here and just click new and we can call this one our

00:27.120 --> 00:33.480
eyes layer because we're gonna create eyes with that and let's come down to our materials panel here

00:34.140 --> 00:36.510
and now we've got this material.

00:36.630 --> 00:44.000
Let's call this one black fill because we want to create a filled circle with this.

00:44.010 --> 00:47.240
So let's come down here to stroke.

00:47.280 --> 00:52.200
We want a line yes with color black but we also want it to be filled.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.460
So let's choose this as well.

00:54.540 --> 01:01.740
So we've got solid and black as well so with our new layer created and our material created.

01:01.740 --> 01:04.750
Let's come over here to the brush size.

01:04.770 --> 01:08.790
Let's take the brush size pretty far down because I think this is going to be pretty small.

01:08.790 --> 01:09.370
Let's.

01:09.990 --> 01:13.990
Let's initially take it down to three and see how that works.

01:14.100 --> 01:21.180
We could increase our strength all the way here and then let's come over here to the circle it's choose

01:21.480 --> 01:27.810
that and in here let's just click and drag and see what happens and you can see there is our filled

01:28.050 --> 01:28.610
circle.

01:28.620 --> 01:35.730
I'm going to hold the Shift key down so it constrains it to a circle instead of an oval.

01:35.850 --> 01:38.610
Analysts just create it right there.

01:38.610 --> 01:39.000
That's good.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.690
Now we can do more adjusting with these but I don't think we need to right now so I'll just hit enter

01:46.200 --> 01:46.830
and there we go.

01:46.830 --> 01:48.840
Now look over here.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.010
There it is.

01:50.010 --> 01:50.280
Right.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.950
So you can see it on the face.

01:52.950 --> 01:56.240
Now it's pulled out a bit from from the face.

01:56.370 --> 02:03.920
And that's OK because once again this is just a temp setup so we can see our 2D face on the character.

02:03.960 --> 02:10.010
Now I'd like to make that a bit smaller so just like any object we can tap into edit mode.

02:10.170 --> 02:12.710
And then we can hit the a key and select that whole thing.

02:12.710 --> 02:16.450
Then we can hit s and scale it in or in or out.

02:16.770 --> 02:23.590
We can take our move tool and move it around and we go like that.

02:23.700 --> 02:28.790
I think I'd like to get rid of the 3d cursor in the origin here just for now as well.

02:28.800 --> 02:36.750
In this view let's come over here and under overlays let's get rid of the origin and the 3d cursor.

02:36.750 --> 02:39.640
There we go just to clean that up a bit.

02:39.640 --> 02:41.980
So let's put that about right here.

02:42.010 --> 02:42.570
There we go.

02:42.570 --> 02:47.970
I'll tap back into object mode for this character and for what we're doing here.

02:47.970 --> 02:53.580
I'm going to have the eyes moving at the same time all the time I'm not going to have one eye blinking

02:53.580 --> 02:54.900
when the other one is open.

02:54.900 --> 03:01.880
So let me tap back into edit mode and I'm just gonna hit shift D and enter and then I'm going to drag

03:01.880 --> 03:02.690
Grover.

03:02.790 --> 03:07.470
And that's going to create the other eye there OK.

03:07.680 --> 03:14.130
So if we tap into edit mode and we have our eyes they still look a little bit too big.

03:14.190 --> 03:20.760
I mean go ahead and select everything over here and I'll just scale them down just a bit and maybe I'll

03:21.330 --> 03:22.640
move them out a bit.

03:22.650 --> 03:24.720
I'll just hit the B key and move this one out.

03:24.720 --> 03:31.290
Some Alt A B key border select these and move them out some.

03:31.310 --> 03:33.110
Let's try that.

03:33.140 --> 03:36.320
OK so that's a good beginning there.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.570
Now we're also going to need a mouth.

03:38.570 --> 03:41.690
So let's go ahead and create a new layer.

03:41.750 --> 03:47.100
I'll hit the Plus call it mouth and when I do this.

03:47.150 --> 03:52.600
Notice that these layers are popping up over here on the grease pencil timeline.

03:52.640 --> 03:53.000
Right.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.130
So each time we create a layer here it appears over here.

03:58.250 --> 03:58.480
All right.

03:58.490 --> 04:03.350
So let me create a new grease pencil stroke by coming over here to draw.

04:03.350 --> 04:10.280
And for this I'm going to create an arc I'm just going to click and then I'll click and drag and look

04:10.280 --> 04:10.790
at this.

04:10.790 --> 04:18.620
Now we've got something that almost looks like a mouth like a frown but it's filled.

04:18.620 --> 04:19.810
I don't want that.

04:20.060 --> 04:26.330
I'll hit enter and I'll press controls Zee and let's figure out what the problem is here what the issue

04:26.330 --> 04:29.590
is is we're using this black fill material again.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.440
Whereas we were using that for the eyes.

04:32.630 --> 04:34.550
We need just a stroke for the mouth.

04:35.210 --> 04:37.730
So let's come over here to the materials.

04:37.730 --> 04:48.140
Let's create a new material here and I'll click new and let's call this black stroke that now we have

04:48.320 --> 04:53.000
stroke line black and fill is unchecked.

04:53.030 --> 04:53.690
So that's good.

04:53.690 --> 04:55.340
Let's try it again now.

04:55.580 --> 05:00.410
Come over here with this selected click and drag and there we go.

05:00.410 --> 05:04.460
Now we can see we've got that drawn out once again with a frown.

05:04.460 --> 05:12.450
We can take this handle right here and click and drag and drag that down like that and then let it enter.

05:12.650 --> 05:13.540
Now that's OK.

05:13.550 --> 05:15.970
But I think it's too thin.

05:15.980 --> 05:22.490
Let's some undo this control Zee and I'm going to come up to the radius and Let's type in five and let's

05:22.490 --> 05:23.900
see how this works.

05:23.900 --> 05:27.980
Now when I clicked and dragged this way I got a frown.

05:28.010 --> 05:30.580
Let's see what happens if I click and drag this way.

05:30.590 --> 05:31.700
There we go.

05:31.700 --> 05:36.440
Now I have a smile so I'll kind of put this right there.

05:36.510 --> 05:37.470
Hit enter.

05:37.880 --> 05:38.570
And there we go.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.780
We've got a cheesy smile.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.100
I think I'd like the smile to be not quite so arched.

05:45.110 --> 05:51.710
So I'm going to press control Zee one more time and I'm going to click and drag this way like this again

05:52.700 --> 05:59.720
and then I'm going to grab this handle and kind of move it up like that just a little bit like this.

05:59.720 --> 06:00.380
There we go.

06:00.470 --> 06:02.480
And I'll hit enter and there we go.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.580
Now we've got the smile.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.250
I'd like the eyebrows as well.

06:06.260 --> 06:12.710
And for the eyebrows I think I may want to move those independently of each other so we may need to

06:12.710 --> 06:18.470
create a new grease pencil layer for each one so we can move them easier.

06:18.470 --> 06:20.840
Now we could do it with all all one layer.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.930
But let me try it with two here.

06:23.000 --> 06:30.890
So I'm going to hit the plus and we'll call this brow underscore ah and then I'll hit the plus and we'll

06:30.890 --> 06:33.840
call this brow underscore Elle.

06:33.960 --> 06:34.290
OK.

06:34.330 --> 06:39.230
Let's try this for the brow on the right.

06:39.230 --> 06:48.250
Let's go ahead and use this line tool here and I'll just click and drag like this and hit enter maybe

06:48.300 --> 06:49.820
a little bit too big.

06:49.890 --> 06:52.540
Let's control Zee and try that again.

06:52.950 --> 06:57.000
Something like this maybe and hit enter.

06:57.210 --> 06:58.100
OK.

06:58.210 --> 07:01.090
And then or the other side.

07:01.090 --> 07:06.220
I'll do the same thing and hit enter.

07:06.230 --> 07:06.880
Okay.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.110
Now if we want we can go in and change these.

07:10.130 --> 07:18.530
So with the L selected here I'll hit the tab key and we can with the point selection tool enabled we

07:18.530 --> 07:23.570
can select a point and I can hit the G key and move this out and make it longer.

07:23.570 --> 07:29.170
I can delete that point and make it shorter so you can adjust these however you want.

07:29.210 --> 07:30.440
Maybe I'll do like that.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.570
Let's try that I think they're too high.

07:33.570 --> 07:39.810
Me a tab into edit mode I'll hit the B key in border select this one.

07:39.810 --> 07:46.480
Move this down like that s border select this one here.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.120
Let's move that down like that.

07:49.120 --> 07:49.780
Okay.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.560
There we go.

07:51.670 --> 07:54.790
I think now I want to adjust this a bit.

07:54.790 --> 08:00.820
I feel like the eyes and the rounds can come down some so if I tab back into edit mode I may just grab

08:00.850 --> 08:07.540
this and move these down a bit like this let's try that yeah that's good.

08:07.540 --> 08:10.230
I also think the eyes should be a little bit smaller.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.780
So I'm going to try this.

08:11.890 --> 08:12.880
I'm going to select.

08:12.880 --> 08:19.480
Actually I'll select them individually I'll hit s and scale this down a bit and then I'll grab this

08:19.480 --> 08:23.200
one and scale it down a bit as well.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.800
Just like that.

08:24.820 --> 08:25.230
All right.

08:25.240 --> 08:28.080
Now I think he's looking a little bit better.

08:28.240 --> 08:36.640
So now that we have the face drawn and pretty much in place if we select the rig let me move over and

08:36.970 --> 08:41.060
select the rig here and change to pose mode.

08:41.230 --> 08:48.730
And if we select the head control see that that 2D face stays with the character.

08:48.730 --> 08:53.990
But you can see over on the left hand side this doesn't move at all.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.350
And this is how we're going to do our animation.

08:56.350 --> 09:03.970
This is how we're going to be able to animate the character on the right here while having the 2D face

09:04.090 --> 09:07.330
locked in place so we can do our drawing here.

09:07.330 --> 09:07.650
All right.

09:07.670 --> 09:10.060
Let me press Alt R to get that back.

09:10.060 --> 09:17.530
The way it was and in the next video let's go ahead and work on creating the idle animation for the

09:17.530 --> 09:18.310
body.

09:18.370 --> 09:26.530
Get that timed out and then we'll create blink animations and maybe move the eyebrows around in sync

09:26.800 --> 09:29.620
with the 3D body that's coming up next.
