WEBVTT

00:00.690 --> 00:03.690
I noticed one thing while playing this back.

00:03.840 --> 00:12.250
If we take a look at the foot here and we scroll forward we see its contact and with the heel it's flat

00:13.030 --> 00:19.080
it's flat then it turns up it's still on the toe and then it's up.

00:19.410 --> 00:28.290
Whereas if we take a look at this foot right here I noticed this foot has the contact it's flat and

00:28.290 --> 00:36.220
then it pulls up and and then it's up on the toe for these two frames as well but right here it still

00:36.220 --> 00:40.780
pulls up and I feel like I should probably fix that.

00:40.930 --> 00:46.960
So to do that what I'm going to do is just select this guy right here and let's press Alt ah and see

00:46.960 --> 00:50.150
how that works and we go yeah.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.290
And that adds a key frame there as well.

00:53.290 --> 00:55.730
So now let's go back.

00:55.750 --> 00:56.410
Here we go.

00:56.410 --> 01:03.070
Contact flat on the ground flat on the ground on the toe and up on the toe.

01:03.070 --> 01:04.540
Yep there we go.

01:04.540 --> 01:07.000
So that's all that needed to happen there.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.230
And now that I've done this let's go ahead and save the file and go to a file save copy and I'll put

01:14.230 --> 01:15.530
that in my exports.

01:15.610 --> 01:21.790
Here's that player run I'll go ahead and write over that there.

01:21.880 --> 01:26.890
OK so now we've got it ready to go for the jump.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.020
Once again I'm going to delete all of these down here.

01:31.020 --> 01:37.080
I'll hover over the timeline down in the dope sheet and press the A key and I'll just delete all of

01:37.080 --> 01:37.660
these.

01:37.740 --> 01:40.290
Hit delete and delete key frames.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.790
And there we go.

01:41.790 --> 01:50.070
Now on frame one I'll select everything in post mode and then press Alt are all g to bring him back

01:50.070 --> 01:53.130
to his default t pose there.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.280
Now for the jump one I want for this.

01:56.550 --> 02:04.260
I think what I want is kind of a Super Mario type thing with one leg forward and one arm forward.

02:04.260 --> 02:07.030
At least that's how I picture him in my head.

02:07.050 --> 02:14.280
That's actually what he's doing or not I don't know but that's what I want is kind of a as if he's leaping

02:14.280 --> 02:17.430
over a hurdle or or or something like that.

02:17.490 --> 02:19.740
Now we're probably gonna need more key frames here.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.010
I'm not exactly sure how many we're gonna need.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.680
Let's take it up to 48 frames.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.170
Just to give us two seconds let's do that.

02:30.240 --> 02:35.850
I'll once again work on the body first and then we'll take a look at the face.

02:36.090 --> 02:43.590
I think I do know that I want his arms down something to go ahead and select the shoulder controls here

02:43.620 --> 02:51.260
and get the arc key and turn these down like that and I'm not going to worry about him moving up in

02:51.260 --> 02:52.120
the z axis.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.260
I'm just going to move the arms and the legs.

02:54.350 --> 02:58.880
Once we get to unity we're gonna script a force upward to make him jump.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.740
So we don't need to apply that force here or move him at all.

03:03.770 --> 03:06.790
All we need to do is just animate the arms and legs.

03:06.830 --> 03:10.120
So from here let's just move up to.

03:10.340 --> 03:13.160
I don't know frame twenty four one second.

03:13.160 --> 03:20.320
Let's see how this works and what I'll do is I'll just come around to this side with the right arm selected

03:20.330 --> 03:29.280
and I'll just spin that up like that I'll go round to the other side and let's spin this one back like

03:29.280 --> 03:33.620
this let's grab a leg.

03:33.620 --> 03:34.700
Here we go.

03:34.700 --> 03:39.950
So if this arm is back then this leg should be forward like this.

03:39.950 --> 03:52.650
Right let's do that and this leg should go back and hit the Aki and rotate like this something like

03:52.650 --> 03:53.490
that.

03:53.540 --> 04:01.380
He's kind of jumping up like that now also I feel like I want to turn some of the torso controls so

04:01.380 --> 04:14.100
maybe maybe he If we tilt this way then I can begin kind of arching the back like this and then maybe

04:14.100 --> 04:18.290
grab that head bone here and turn it down a bit.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.880
So he's still looking forward.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.230
Let's see how that works.

04:23.310 --> 04:23.700
OK.

04:23.700 --> 04:24.660
That's not too bad.

04:24.660 --> 04:27.490
I think I want to maybe move that head back a little bit.

04:27.490 --> 04:28.170
They're like this.

04:28.200 --> 04:32.050
So he's kind of jumping up like that.

04:32.090 --> 04:32.350
All right.

04:32.360 --> 04:33.650
Let's see how that works.

04:33.650 --> 04:40.970
So now if we grab this cursor on the timeline with the right mouse button and scroll back it kind of

04:40.970 --> 04:42.260
goes like that.

04:42.260 --> 04:44.630
Now let me take all of these.

04:44.630 --> 04:50.240
I'm going to click the top key frame here to select that whole column and I'll press shift D and move

04:50.270 --> 04:51.930
these down like that.

04:51.950 --> 04:57.350
Now let's hit play and see about the timing really bad.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.310
OK.

04:59.750 --> 05:06.150
So you can kind of see where I'm going here but we need more snap more energy to it.

05:06.230 --> 05:09.710
It's kind of the laziest jump I've ever seen.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.100
OK.

05:10.130 --> 05:14.270
So clearly I don't think we're going to need two whole seconds for this.

05:14.300 --> 05:21.470
So let's take this column of key frames and hit the G key and move these back like this.

05:21.470 --> 05:24.380
And let's take this and move these in like this.

05:24.380 --> 05:25.390
So we've got it.

05:25.520 --> 05:33.520
Let's have it all happen in about one second so I'll change my in time to 24.

05:33.530 --> 05:35.470
Let's try this.

05:35.480 --> 05:39.410
All right I'll hit that spacebar OK.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.940
So a little better.

05:41.950 --> 05:48.370
Now let's take this row of key frames and move it back to say frame eight and then let's duplicate these

05:48.370 --> 05:50.950
with shift D and move these out too.

05:50.950 --> 05:53.930
I don't know 16 or or 18.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.740
Let's try 17.

05:55.750 --> 05:56.320
How about that.

05:56.350 --> 05:58.060
Let's hit the spacebar

06:01.350 --> 06:01.820
OK.

06:01.830 --> 06:08.850
So he's jumping and then he's holding it's not too bad.

06:08.850 --> 06:11.930
I feel like it needs to be a little bit longer.

06:12.030 --> 06:15.290
Let's grab these and move these to frame.

06:15.320 --> 06:22.500
Thirty two let's border select all of these with the B key and move these into the center.

06:22.510 --> 06:30.230
And what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to grab this column and this column and move them out a bit.

06:30.310 --> 06:34.820
Let's change our frame range here back to 32.

06:35.210 --> 06:36.610
At that base bar

06:42.230 --> 06:43.960
feels a little better.

06:43.960 --> 06:44.530
OK.

06:44.540 --> 06:51.030
But I think right in here where would that be say on 16.

06:51.170 --> 06:57.290
Feel like I need something to happen here like a little bit of an extreme or something.

06:57.290 --> 07:06.120
So if we hit play he kind of holds and I'd kind of like him to move a little bit there while he's holding.

07:06.180 --> 07:11.910
So somewhere around 16 I think what I'm gonna do is just push everything a little bit more just make

07:11.910 --> 07:15.470
everything a little bit more extreme so pull that back

07:18.700 --> 07:32.120
maybe pull this board just everything's gonna push just a bit out and up and back and rotate out.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.370
Maybe he can even

07:36.890 --> 07:39.690
arch that back a little bit more.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.050
Just see how that works.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.100
I'm not sure let's give it a try

07:47.780 --> 07:48.800
that might just work.

07:48.800 --> 07:59.190
So that's 32 frames and you gotta try and imagine him kind of shooting up into the air as he does this.

07:59.260 --> 08:03.830
In fact I may even need it to pop quicker.

08:03.970 --> 08:10.860
Here let me take this column of key frames and move them back maybe to frame for.

08:10.870 --> 08:16.600
Let's see how this works shift arrow to go back at that spacebar

08:21.150 --> 08:24.150
that feels a little bit snappier

08:31.900 --> 08:32.390
All right.

08:32.390 --> 08:34.040
That's not too bad.

08:34.610 --> 08:43.330
I feel like it may be going on a little bit too long still so maybe I'm going to take all of these and

08:43.360 --> 08:52.540
let's move them to G and let's move them back to here so this in frame is at frame 30 let's hit let's

08:52.540 --> 09:01.950
change the frame range back to 30 at that spacebar.

09:02.170 --> 09:05.210
I feel like that's getting there.

09:05.350 --> 09:10.740
You know you kind of springs and then it comes back down

09:16.150 --> 09:21.310
this is kind of a tough one because we may actually need to get it into unity before we see exactly

09:21.310 --> 09:24.120
how this is going to work and then come back here.

09:24.130 --> 09:28.040
But I don't know I feel like that might just work

09:31.220 --> 09:36.390
I guess what we should do is go ahead and work on the face animation in the next video.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.080
So we'll do that.

09:38.090 --> 09:38.840
Coming up next.
