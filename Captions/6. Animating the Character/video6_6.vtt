00:00.620 --> 00:08.000
Well since the last video I went ahead and downloaded the very latest version of Blender 2.8 beta and

00:08.060 --> 00:10.310
of course since is still a development version.

00:10.310 --> 00:16.750
Things can change and sure enough the look of the timeline has changed since the last version.

00:16.760 --> 00:22.040
So still all the same key frames and everything just a little bit different aesthetic to it.

00:22.070 --> 00:23.450
That's all I guess.

00:23.660 --> 00:33.260
So before we create our geo face run and jump let's go ahead and render this 2D animation out to an

00:33.260 --> 00:36.360
image sequence and then we're gonna bring it back.

00:36.440 --> 00:39.220
Apply it to our Geo face.

00:39.260 --> 00:46.760
Idle object and see if it's the right size and if it isn't then we'll scale the UVA island up or down

00:46.940 --> 00:48.580
to get it to be just the right size.

00:48.590 --> 00:56.270
And once we do that then we know we can duplicate these and use them for the other face animations as

00:56.270 --> 00:56.780
well.

00:56.780 --> 00:58.760
So let's give this a try.

00:58.760 --> 01:03.470
First of all we're not going to need to see the character in the render for this.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.130
So I can turn off the render view here.

01:07.160 --> 01:13.490
We're not going to need to see this geo face idle in the render we will need to see the grease pencil

01:13.490 --> 01:21.530
object so we'll leave that and we won't need to see the armature in the render either so I'll just click

01:21.530 --> 01:21.840
that.

01:21.870 --> 01:26.960
So we're just taking all these away hiding them away in the render.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.820
All right let's go over here to the output tab right here.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.840
And as we said before we're at 24 frames per second.

01:32.840 --> 01:37.250
We've already set up our resolution to be 256 pixels.

01:37.790 --> 01:40.460
Let's come down here and under the output.

01:40.460 --> 01:48.530
Let's point this to a particular folder so I'll click here and I'll browse to my folder and in here

01:48.980 --> 01:51.130
I'm going to create a new folder.

01:51.140 --> 01:59.940
I'll just click right here and we'll call this renders and in that folder what I'd also like to do is

01:59.940 --> 02:03.380
create a folder and I'll call this idol.

02:03.510 --> 02:03.960
There we go.

02:03.960 --> 02:09.120
So this is the folder that we want to actually send our rendered images to.

02:09.120 --> 02:12.940
So I'll click accept and you can see here's the path.

02:13.260 --> 02:17.070
Now currently we're going to be outputting PND which is fine.

02:17.070 --> 02:23.880
And we also want this RG be a we went the A four Alpha that alpha channel is going to allow everything

02:23.880 --> 02:28.800
that isn't the grease pencil strokes to be clear to be transparent.

02:28.800 --> 02:37.380
Now to ensure we get that transparency we should come over to the render panel here and under film we

02:37.380 --> 02:40.470
should choose instead of sky for the Alpha.

02:40.470 --> 02:42.810
We want it to be transparent right there.

02:42.810 --> 02:43.200
OK.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.560
So we still have the Eevee render engine.

02:45.570 --> 02:52.440
We've got the alpha transparent and we've created the folder in which all the renters are going to go.

02:52.590 --> 02:52.860
All right.

02:52.890 --> 03:00.450
So let's go back to that folder here so here's our folder with the renders and we've got the idle folder

03:00.450 --> 03:01.440
here.

03:01.590 --> 03:03.360
That's where it's gonna go.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.400
So here we go.

03:05.400 --> 03:14.370
We're gonna go to render render animation and there it goes.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.050
All right.

03:15.050 --> 03:17.240
It has rendered all of our frames.

03:17.240 --> 03:21.310
Let's go ahead and close this and I'll open up that folder again.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.070
And here it is.

03:22.100 --> 03:28.100
You can see them all from one all the way to one 43 All right.

03:28.100 --> 03:31.600
So if we open one up you can see that's all we have.

03:31.610 --> 03:33.390
Just a small face.

03:33.590 --> 03:36.300
Now here comes the fun part.

03:36.380 --> 03:44.540
What we need to do is map that back onto our geo face idle object as a texture so to do that.

03:44.540 --> 03:51.050
Let's go back to our shading tab and really all we need to do is just bring it into this image texture

03:51.050 --> 03:51.660
node.

03:51.740 --> 03:56.810
But before we do that let's hide the grease pencil object for just a moment.

03:56.810 --> 03:59.440
Let's come over here and hide that here.

03:59.450 --> 04:00.600
There it is.

04:00.620 --> 04:05.610
Now let's bring in our image sequence here so I'll click open.

04:05.990 --> 04:09.350
It says detect sequences here and that's checked.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.740
So that's good.

04:10.850 --> 04:16.170
We go into renders and Idol and we click on the first frame.

04:16.250 --> 04:25.730
Let's now come over here to open image and instead of single image we can change this to image sequence.

04:25.730 --> 04:27.440
Let's do that.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.930
Now currently the color is white.

04:29.960 --> 04:35.870
If we take the base color here and drag that all the way down we can turn it black and that's what we

04:35.870 --> 04:36.950
want.

04:36.950 --> 04:39.420
And once again this is just a temporary setup.

04:39.440 --> 04:45.400
We're just doing this to see how big that u v map or that u v island should be.

04:45.440 --> 04:48.890
And it looks to me like that they should be a little bit bigger.

04:48.890 --> 04:52.640
So let's go over to our UVA editing tab.

04:52.700 --> 04:53.720
Let's come over here.

04:53.720 --> 04:59.240
And with all of these selected all of these UVA is selected let's hit the esky and let's just scale

04:59.240 --> 05:03.940
it down a bit and you can see as we do we can make it bigger or smaller.

05:03.950 --> 05:05.160
However we want here.

05:05.180 --> 05:12.290
But if I move this up about like this and then also I think I'd like to move it up some.

05:12.290 --> 05:20.650
So let's take this and move it up a bit and I'm just going to move this around until I get it about

05:20.680 --> 05:22.820
where I want it.

05:22.890 --> 05:23.130
All right.

05:23.130 --> 05:27.810
So then I'll hit the ESC again and scale this up a bit.

05:27.810 --> 05:29.220
Is that about right.

05:29.220 --> 05:32.340
Oh I feel like it needs to be a little bit bigger here

05:36.570 --> 05:36.850
there.

05:36.880 --> 05:37.540
Let's try that.

05:37.540 --> 05:46.750
I'll tap back into object mode and there he is I mean move that cursor back to the world origin I think

05:46.750 --> 05:49.420
though maybe it needs to come up just a little bit.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.320
Let me do this again.

05:51.400 --> 05:59.830
I'm going to hit key and why and slide that up just a bit like that there we go.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.390
I think that's going to be how I want it.

06:02.480 --> 06:02.770
Yes.

06:02.770 --> 06:07.000
So now you can see that too the image on the actual object.

06:07.010 --> 06:09.490
We're going to use in unity now.

06:09.650 --> 06:14.030
If we then come down here and hit the spacebar what happens.

06:14.100 --> 06:14.990
I'll do that.

06:14.990 --> 06:17.460
And we're not seeing the blink.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.040
So why is that.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.800
Well I think I may know.

06:21.800 --> 06:28.310
Let's press shift arrow and go back to the beginning and if we go back to our use the editing screen

06:28.310 --> 06:28.660
layout.

06:28.670 --> 06:33.840
No I'm sorry our shading screen layout here.

06:34.010 --> 06:34.700
Look at this.

06:34.700 --> 06:39.130
This says image sequence but it says how many frames.

06:39.290 --> 06:44.450
And we need to put in one forty three right there.

06:44.570 --> 06:50.540
And while we're here let's go ahead and turn on auto refresh as well so it will refresh each frame as

06:50.540 --> 06:51.900
it goes along.

06:51.950 --> 06:52.540
OK.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.020
So I think we're ready.

06:54.020 --> 07:02.360
Let's go back to our 2D animation and hit that spacebar and let's see what happens there we go there.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.540
He's blinking now.

07:03.680 --> 07:11.690
The actual quality of the image is pretty poor because we're doing this in real time so the image quality

07:11.690 --> 07:14.130
is going to be quite a bit better in unity.

07:14.210 --> 07:21.680
But you can see the actual texture playing through the image sequence as well as the character animating

07:21.920 --> 07:23.610
with the animation cycle.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.670
So it works.

07:25.730 --> 07:28.210
That's I think what we needed to see.

07:28.250 --> 07:37.070
So since that's the case we can now come over and duplicate these duplicate this object because we now

07:37.070 --> 07:40.190
have the object parenting to the head bone.

07:40.190 --> 07:43.280
We have a transparent material on it.

07:43.280 --> 07:54.030
We have you v mapped the object so that the U V map is the proper size and we've tested the image sequence

07:54.030 --> 07:54.990
on it as well.

07:54.990 --> 07:57.840
So I think we're ready to go ahead and duplicate this.

07:57.870 --> 07:58.760
So let's do that.

07:58.770 --> 08:07.560
Let's select that let's press shift D and enter and instead of geo face idle let's go ahead and call

08:07.560 --> 08:20.140
this geo face run and we'll duplicate this and we'll call this geo face jump and there we go.

08:20.150 --> 08:22.930
Now let's come down here to the materials.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.940
I'm going to go back over to our shading here.

08:25.970 --> 08:32.080
Let's come over to our materials now and for the jump.

08:32.190 --> 08:37.440
Let's go ahead and duplicate the material the idol material let's duplicate it for the jump.

08:37.440 --> 08:43.280
Now I can just delete this or remove the material slot here and then create a new material.

08:43.410 --> 08:50.580
But I want to make a copy of it and to do that I need to click this button here so I click this and

08:50.580 --> 09:00.010
we'll call this jump and we go and I'll go ahead and remove that image sequence out of here because

09:00.010 --> 09:09.960
we don't need that and we go and then let's go ahead and or the face run once again let's duplicate

09:09.960 --> 09:15.240
this and call this base run.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.430
There we go.

09:16.440 --> 09:20.240
So now we have three different objects with three different materials.

09:20.250 --> 09:23.840
Oh I can go ahead and remove the image sequence out of here.

09:24.030 --> 09:28.130
All parents to the head bone and ready to go.

09:28.140 --> 09:37.510
So with all of that done now we can do in the next video is begin creating our run animation.

09:37.590 --> 09:44.910
We will hide the idol and the jump will bring back the grease pencil object and we'll begin creating

09:45.120 --> 09:46.290
the run animation.
