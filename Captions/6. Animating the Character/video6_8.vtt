WEBVTT

00:00.670 --> 00:00.970
All right.

00:00.970 --> 00:09.280
We've got frame 1 and 2 and 7 and 8 which are pretty much the same things if we hit the spacebar.

00:09.280 --> 00:14.980
That's what we have so far and it's pretty amazing how much you can get from just two main key frames

00:14.980 --> 00:18.430
there but there's more that we can do here.

00:18.460 --> 00:25.920
So after frame two that foot that's on the ground here that really needs to stay on the ground.

00:25.930 --> 00:30.090
But if we move to frame three look see how it's already pulled up.

00:30.160 --> 00:37.780
So because of the interpolation between this key frame and this key frame frame three is pulled up a

00:37.780 --> 00:38.610
bit.

00:38.620 --> 00:46.360
So what let's do is let's grab that left foot right there and let's press control our control or vault

00:46.420 --> 00:48.870
are and all gee let's do that.

00:49.060 --> 00:52.130
Maybe we could move that up oh Right about here.

00:52.150 --> 00:55.110
Let's see there.

00:55.270 --> 00:55.540
Yeah.

00:55.570 --> 01:01.180
We may want to move them up just a little bit more like that like this.

01:01.180 --> 01:01.780
Yeah.

01:01.930 --> 01:03.990
Down slide.

01:04.030 --> 01:04.930
There we go.

01:04.930 --> 01:09.330
And notice how the right foot is passing here.

01:09.330 --> 01:10.900
I'm on the press control three again.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.580
How it's passing by.

01:12.580 --> 01:13.360
And that's good.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.510
We want that.

01:14.650 --> 01:19.010
I might rotate this just a bit like this.

01:19.090 --> 01:26.530
Uh with these short stubby legs it's gonna be hard to keep the toe from crossing into the ground plain.

01:26.970 --> 01:28.450
But I think that's gonna be okay.

01:28.470 --> 01:33.240
It's gonna happen so quickly that I don't know that that's gonna be a problem per say but let's let's

01:33.240 --> 01:34.650
give that a try.

01:34.650 --> 01:39.870
So now we need that hips to come up just a bit.

01:39.870 --> 01:48.710
So we've had it go down now we should have it come back up just a smidge like this and these arms I

01:48.710 --> 01:50.390
think are actually pretty good.

01:50.390 --> 01:53.280
They're pretty close to being what we need.

01:53.360 --> 02:01.640
We could take this one and move it back just a smidge and then we could take this one and move it forward

02:01.640 --> 02:03.480
just a smidge like that.

02:03.510 --> 02:11.530
I mean come back to our rig tab here and choose in front so we can see the two controls on either side.

02:11.540 --> 02:17.150
If you want to do that instead of switching back and forth I'm going to go ahead and keep it off just

02:17.150 --> 02:19.190
because it cleans up the view.

02:19.910 --> 02:20.210
All right.

02:20.210 --> 02:23.680
So maybe with this I'll rotate this back just a bit like that.

02:23.750 --> 02:24.070
Okay.

02:24.070 --> 02:26.080
So let's see how this works.

02:26.120 --> 02:28.780
One two three.

02:28.790 --> 02:29.140
Yep.

02:29.290 --> 02:30.120
OK.

02:30.230 --> 02:32.860
That's that's actually pretty good.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.860
Let's do the same thing over here at frame nine.

02:36.980 --> 02:39.110
This foot is flat on the ground.

02:39.140 --> 02:43.750
So on frame nine that should still be flat on the ground.

02:43.760 --> 02:49.040
So let's press all are all G and get that flat on the ground there.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.560
And I think we want to move it forward just a bit.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.350
Let's click on frame three okay.

02:57.340 --> 03:09.520
It looks like I've got the other foot back a bit like this Yep and maybe tilted or we're just a bit

03:09.520 --> 03:12.430
like that okay.

03:12.430 --> 03:15.940
And we need to bring up that hips control just a bit like that.

03:15.940 --> 03:19.370
So click on three nine.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.130
Well let's see it looks like I've got

03:24.770 --> 03:24.980
yeah.

03:24.990 --> 03:29.210
That should come down a little bit more like.

03:29.260 --> 03:30.790
There we go.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.550
We need to deal with the arms right.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.020
So let's do that.

03:35.080 --> 03:44.800
Let's bring this forward some control three and let's bring this arm back some right.

03:44.800 --> 03:45.670
Let's give that a try.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.070
Let's see how that works.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.020
Get the spacebar

03:50.690 --> 03:51.820
OK.

03:51.830 --> 03:52.620
Here he goes.

03:53.570 --> 03:59.060
All right let's go back to frame three and let's move forward again.

03:59.060 --> 04:06.860
So if we move now up to frame for what should be happening here we've got the left foot here is on its

04:06.860 --> 04:07.870
heel.

04:08.210 --> 04:10.760
We've got that foot flat.

04:10.760 --> 04:12.740
Got that foot flat again.

04:13.340 --> 04:19.610
It's come up off the ground plain again on this frame but it's kind of doing what we want it to but

04:19.640 --> 04:23.230
we have a special foot control to do this.

04:23.270 --> 04:27.380
We want the foot to begin coming up on the toe right.

04:27.380 --> 04:35.240
This is why we created that foot roll right here so let's take this and press old are all gee let's

04:35.240 --> 04:42.920
move this back a bit Let's select that foot roll control right there and let's hit ah and roll that

04:42.920 --> 04:51.790
up and that's what we want that foot beginning to roll up a bit like this we take that control and move

04:51.790 --> 04:55.650
it back a bit Yeah I think something like that

04:58.240 --> 05:04.840
and the other side should probably well we could tend to tilt it down and it's beginning to come forward

05:04.840 --> 05:13.860
like this maybe and we want that hips control to come back up to about where it was at frame one in

05:13.860 --> 05:19.860
fact I guess what we should do is just take that control that route bone key frame right there and just

05:19.950 --> 05:27.060
press shift D and move it right there so let's try this

05:30.550 --> 05:30.780
yeah.

05:30.780 --> 05:34.380
So it goes down comes back up to where it was

05:37.050 --> 05:37.360
yeah.

05:37.500 --> 05:43.860
OK so that's the same key frame as this went back here for the route.

05:43.860 --> 05:50.620
Now for the arms on this this is probably going to continue to come forward like this control three

05:50.710 --> 05:53.600
and this is probably going to continue to go back like that.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.150
All right.

05:54.340 --> 05:56.770
Let's see yeah.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.330
Well that's what we want.

05:59.700 --> 06:06.270
OK let's do that same thing now over here on frame 10.

06:06.330 --> 06:11.970
So once again we've got to have the right foot now on the ground.

06:11.970 --> 06:14.700
So we've got him on the ground here right.

06:14.700 --> 06:17.790
I mean press control three and go round to this side.

06:17.790 --> 06:19.810
We have it on the ground here.

06:19.830 --> 06:23.300
We need it to stay on the ground on frame 10.

06:23.340 --> 06:26.310
So let's press Alt R and I'll g.

06:26.310 --> 06:34.390
And then we can put it right about here I guess select that put control hit ah and roll that forward

06:34.390 --> 06:43.730
some maybe bring that back a little like this let's also take this one and oh now take a look at this.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.870
So let me roll this back here OK.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.200
I'm going to go over to the other side here.

06:49.400 --> 07:01.140
Now as we go forward here we've changed the key frame on our foot roll here on frame for right here.

07:01.130 --> 07:09.700
Well we had a key frame for that on frame one but we didn't have a key frame for it on two or three

07:09.710 --> 07:14.510
so you can see it coming up off of that as we get to frame four.

07:14.540 --> 07:20.780
Let's see where that is if I hit the period key we can go down and see that right there it'll frame

07:20.780 --> 07:21.320
that up.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.350
So here's that foot control.

07:23.360 --> 07:33.380
But here right here is that foot roll so we have a frame here with the foot roll inactive and a frame

07:33.380 --> 07:42.950
here with it active with it rolled forward so we need to add a key frame here maybe duplicate this key

07:42.950 --> 07:49.390
frame shifty and move it up to here to hold that flat as you take the step.

07:49.560 --> 07:49.890
Right.

07:49.910 --> 07:56.640
And then it comes up at frame for in addition if we go out here and look at it here.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.200
So that's ugly.

07:58.720 --> 08:06.180
Let's go and select that foot control or foot roll again come down to the timeline hit the period key.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.630
And here we are.

08:07.630 --> 08:14.590
So what we should probably do is take this key frame and just duplicated again shift D and move it to

08:14.590 --> 08:15.230
here.

08:15.280 --> 08:19.720
So it's flat we'll need to do that with this one as well.

08:19.820 --> 08:21.490
See how it's up like that.

08:21.740 --> 08:28.970
If we select that foot roll here it is right here so let's press shift D and move that all the way over

08:28.990 --> 08:29.570
there.

08:29.580 --> 08:30.670
There we go.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.060
Now that flattens it out.

08:32.870 --> 08:40.580
So all we're doing is just making sure that things aren't activated don't begin moving until we want

08:40.580 --> 08:41.000
them to.

08:41.000 --> 08:49.060
So we have to sometimes duplicate a key frame to hold that position until it begin to move again.

08:49.060 --> 08:56.860
All right so let's go forward to frame 10 and see how we're doing here we're not doing too bad.

08:56.860 --> 09:00.820
Is that where we wanted to be.

09:00.830 --> 09:02.600
Not really.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.070
So we kind of want

09:06.630 --> 09:10.240
this to be more like this.

09:10.250 --> 09:10.870
Right.

09:10.920 --> 09:21.540
When I click on frame for and it looks like we could take this and slide it back maybe move this back.

09:21.540 --> 09:29.940
Let's try that for 10 or 10 not too far off

09:34.700 --> 09:35.680
and we go.

09:35.890 --> 09:42.340
Also we need to grab the hips key frame so we'll select the route.

09:42.510 --> 09:44.120
Here it is right here.

09:44.430 --> 09:46.880
Shift to and move it to there.

09:46.890 --> 09:50.290
So that brings it up again right.

09:50.370 --> 09:59.500
So we have frame one two three and four with the contact pose when the heel is contacting the ground

09:59.970 --> 10:08.650
the down pose where the weight comes down as far as it's going to in the cycle we have frame three here

10:08.650 --> 10:11.090
as it's coming back up.

10:11.250 --> 10:16.770
We have frame four or the passing pose where one foot passes the other.

10:16.770 --> 10:21.630
So with frame 10 we need to move those arms.

10:21.630 --> 10:23.570
Now it looks like.

10:24.450 --> 10:28.750
So we need to have the arms move back a bit

10:31.480 --> 10:38.220
like this control three maybe move this forward is that right.

10:42.190 --> 10:43.090
I think so.

10:43.090 --> 10:43.380
Yeah.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.160
Okay.

10:47.100 --> 10:50.400
Now number five frame five.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.080
We can call the up pose.

10:52.080 --> 10:59.730
The up position because he's gonna be up as far as he's gonna be throughout the cycle but that foot

10:59.850 --> 11:05.760
still needs to be on the ground that toe still needs to be barely touching the ground.

11:06.180 --> 11:09.040
So let's grab the left foot here.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.460
Let's press Alt are all G.

11:11.520 --> 11:12.650
Put that on the ground.

11:12.660 --> 11:14.130
Let's pull it back.

11:14.910 --> 11:22.380
And let's choose that foot roll control and hit R and roll it up as far as it'll go.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.580
There we go.

11:23.580 --> 11:28.560
And then let's take the hips and move them up as far as they're gonna go.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.500
So we don't want to break the limb like that.

11:31.500 --> 11:38.080
We don't want it to bend backwards but we do want to be able to kind of bring it up like that.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.430
Let's see if it's from here to here.

11:40.440 --> 11:40.650
Yeah.

11:40.670 --> 11:41.620
It goes up some.

11:41.670 --> 11:42.750
That's good.

11:43.500 --> 11:54.520
Let's see if we can move this back a little while we go and then this foot should probably come forward

11:54.520 --> 11:58.500
like this.

11:58.610 --> 12:02.200
We go let's take a look at this

12:05.910 --> 12:06.610
okay.

12:09.260 --> 12:09.590
All right.

12:09.620 --> 12:20.600
So we have the contact down the passing pose and the up right here.

12:20.780 --> 12:25.180
All right let's try and do the same up pose on the other side.

12:25.280 --> 12:32.330
So at frame eleven over here let's try and do that same thing.

12:32.420 --> 12:40.500
So I'm going to grab the hips right here and press shifty and move that over to eleven.

12:40.700 --> 12:44.050
So it goes from ten up to eleven.

12:44.090 --> 12:45.790
Let's put this on the ground.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.410
Let's press all are all G.

12:48.470 --> 12:50.180
Put that on the ground.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.740
Let's turn this up.

12:51.740 --> 12:55.300
The put control up as far as it'll go.

12:55.310 --> 13:01.860
And then let's pull this back as far as we think it can go without it breaking without it bending backwards.

13:02.150 --> 13:04.840
So about like that let's say.

13:04.850 --> 13:05.150
All right.

13:05.150 --> 13:07.560
Let's click on five OK.

13:07.570 --> 13:09.870
That's where the foot is.

13:09.960 --> 13:16.550
I'm gonna grab that and move it move it up turn it a bit was that

13:20.480 --> 13:25.280
not bad like this should come back a little bit.

13:25.460 --> 13:27.170
This should come up a little bit

13:33.510 --> 13:34.390
all right.

13:34.390 --> 13:34.660
Yeah.

13:34.660 --> 13:36.450
We're getting there now.

13:36.490 --> 13:39.060
The arms.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.960
We could take this forward just a bit.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.670
Well actually they're pretty good.

13:45.680 --> 13:49.750
Let me see here in here

13:54.310 --> 13:54.540
yeah.

13:54.550 --> 13:56.550
They're pretty good.

13:56.630 --> 13:58.770
I think the arms are OK.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.060
All right well let's hit play and see what happens.

14:03.780 --> 14:04.190
All right.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.700
That isn't too bad.

14:05.820 --> 14:14.250
I think what let's do now is let's choose all of these key frames right here this whole row I'm going

14:14.250 --> 14:23.340
to click on the top one and I'm gonna move that out 13 and then what we put on 6 will be the same as

14:23.480 --> 14:23.910
12.

14:23.940 --> 14:28.830
So if we there we go that moves a little smoother I think.

14:28.830 --> 14:30.480
Yeah I think that's OK.

14:30.480 --> 14:31.820
I think that's pretty good.

14:31.830 --> 14:39.120
So what let's do in the next video is let's go ahead and work on changing the expression of the face

14:39.150 --> 14:40.410
over here in the 2D.

14:40.710 --> 14:43.860
And then we'll have the run animation pretty much done.
