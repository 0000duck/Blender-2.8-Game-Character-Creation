00:00.760 --> 00:06.370
To get some of this sculpting detail on the hair we can use blenders sculpting tools of course.

00:06.520 --> 00:13.090
And also I think there's a little bit of fine detail micro detail on here too that maybe we could add

00:13.090 --> 00:14.520
that as well.

00:14.560 --> 00:19.570
So first of all I think what we're gonna need to do is split the hair out as its own object because

00:19.570 --> 00:22.030
I don't want to sculpt on this model here.

00:22.030 --> 00:29.710
This is my final one so I'm going to duplicate the hair do the sculpting on the duplicate then bake

00:29.800 --> 00:30.910
a normal map.

00:31.030 --> 00:35.800
Then we can apply that normal map back to our main character here.

00:35.830 --> 00:43.810
So let's go over to the layout tab and for this I think we just need to select the hair so I'll tab

00:43.810 --> 00:49.180
into edit mode and then let's press the L key to select just the hair.

00:49.180 --> 00:55.870
Now what let's do is let's duplicate this with shift D and I'll hit enter and then we want to split

00:55.900 --> 00:58.960
this duplicate mesh out from this object.

00:58.990 --> 01:04.980
So it's its own object so we'll press the p key and then we can separate by selection.

01:05.170 --> 01:05.680
There we go.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.540
So now it's its own object.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.210
Let's come over here and give it a name.

01:09.220 --> 01:12.490
Let's call it Hair sculpt.

01:12.490 --> 01:20.020
Let's do that and now if I take this object and drag it into that main scene collection we can pull

01:20.020 --> 01:23.120
it out of the character scene collection.

01:23.290 --> 01:29.080
And that allows me to hide the character and just have the hair sculpt object here.

01:29.080 --> 01:29.380
All right.

01:29.410 --> 01:34.600
So now that we've got this this is what we're actually going to do the sculpting on let's go over to

01:34.600 --> 01:38.430
the sculpting tab and let's begin working on this.

01:38.470 --> 01:44.800
Now once again I'm going to switch over to my graphics tablet and here in sculpting mode if you want

01:44.800 --> 01:52.120
to zoom in and frame up a particular object you can hover over it and then press the period key on the

01:52.120 --> 01:55.380
NUM pad and that will frame it up.

01:55.390 --> 01:59.440
So the tumble is centered at that point.

01:59.440 --> 02:03.730
So for this particular object I'm going to use the multi resolution modifier.

02:03.730 --> 02:10.840
I think it's really easy to generate pretty good looking scope detail and then bake a normal map out

02:10.840 --> 02:12.790
without having to read it apologize.

02:13.060 --> 02:14.050
It's pretty handy.

02:14.080 --> 02:22.270
So I'm going to come over here to the modifiers panel and click Add modifier and choose multi resolution

02:23.320 --> 02:31.660
I will hit the subdivide button several times maybe may be up to sculpt four and then I'll also increase

02:31.660 --> 02:34.300
the preview up to four as well.

02:34.300 --> 02:40.090
Now that we've done that we can do a few tests here to see how our sculpt tools work.

02:40.090 --> 02:46.510
If I click and drag here you can see I've added a sculpt stroke but it's also on the other side and

02:46.510 --> 02:47.560
I don't think I want that.

02:47.560 --> 02:53.620
This particular sculpt detail isn't going to be symmetrical so I'm going to come over here and turn

02:53.620 --> 03:01.270
off symmetry that first let me press control Z and I'll bring down the symmetry menu and turn off the

03:01.270 --> 03:02.440
X mirror there.

03:02.440 --> 03:05.970
Okay so now if I click and drag that's what we get.

03:05.980 --> 03:06.330
Okay.

03:06.340 --> 03:07.660
That's good.

03:07.660 --> 03:13.410
Just like in the texturing view we can hit the f key and reduce the size of the brush.

03:13.420 --> 03:18.490
Also we have a lot more tools over here and it's sometimes kind of hard to know what they are.

03:18.490 --> 03:25.390
So I'm going to hover over here and click and drag and pull this out so we can actually see the names

03:25.570 --> 03:27.120
of the tools here.

03:27.190 --> 03:31.120
Mainly we're just going to be using the draw and the smooth tool.

03:31.120 --> 03:34.350
Also I think I need that reference image over here again.

03:34.360 --> 03:43.670
So I'll just create a new window here and let's bring in an image editor and let's find that image.

03:43.670 --> 03:44.150
There it is.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.490
So this is kind of what I want to do.

03:47.330 --> 03:55.370
So let's do a few more test scopes here I think I want to cut in right like that for the part in the

03:55.370 --> 04:03.290
hair and the way you cut in as you hold the control key and drag and that then creates kind of a cut

04:03.290 --> 04:12.280
in or pushed in stroke so let me come over here and be I'll make this a little bit bigger and I'll hold

04:12.280 --> 04:15.220
control and click and drag and let's see how that works.

04:15.220 --> 04:17.440
Now it's a little bit too big.

04:17.440 --> 04:23.230
Let me reduce that a smidge and let's try that again.

04:23.380 --> 04:24.430
See how that worked.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.040
That's not bad.

04:27.040 --> 04:32.440
I kind of feel like it needs to be a little bit deeper or more angled cut.

04:32.440 --> 04:39.610
So let's come over here to our fall off again and let me try this one right here where we have more

04:39.610 --> 04:47.240
of a steep angle on the stroke once again press control and kind of move that back.

04:47.270 --> 04:49.570
Yeah I think that's a little bit better.

04:49.650 --> 04:54.300
So let me try again.

04:54.330 --> 05:04.290
No I think I wanted to come back more horizontal so let me try this again.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.560
That's not bad.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.410
Yeah I think I like that.

05:07.540 --> 05:08.260
All right.

05:08.260 --> 05:14.620
There are these tiny artifacts back here but we'll go through this after we do our strokes and we'll

05:14.920 --> 05:19.310
bring in the smooth brush and see what we can do to clean that up.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.470
So I think I just want one two maybe three more strokes here.

05:23.470 --> 05:28.710
Let's try this press control and I might go this way.

05:28.810 --> 05:30.570
No not quite.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.530
It's kind of it's gonna take me a few times here.

05:33.540 --> 05:41.960
It always does and you know what I could do is I could bring in or I could turn on this smooth stroke

05:42.050 --> 05:42.430
again.

05:42.440 --> 05:50.330
Let's try this and if I press control and click and drag you can see there's this stroke.

05:50.330 --> 05:51.710
See how that worked.

05:51.770 --> 05:53.480
That's not bad.

05:53.480 --> 05:57.680
Well I kind of want this to come up a little more so let's do it one more time.

05:59.330 --> 06:03.330
Like this round like that.

06:04.420 --> 06:08.130
Yeah that's a little bit more I like these parallel here.

06:08.250 --> 06:08.800
OK.

06:09.910 --> 06:12.250
It looks like there's one way down here in the front.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.620
Let's try and get that one in there.

06:18.620 --> 06:19.600
That.

06:19.710 --> 06:19.960
Yeah.

06:20.040 --> 06:20.430
OK.

06:20.430 --> 06:21.850
That looks pretty good.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.820
And then there's one way up here on top.

06:23.820 --> 06:26.220
Let's try and get one up here.

06:26.220 --> 06:30.990
I'm just going to hold that control key click and drag and then drag out here.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.820
Now that's a little bit too close.

06:33.830 --> 06:39.430
Let me get it up a little higher on the head here like this.

06:39.460 --> 06:42.690
See how that works.

06:42.740 --> 06:43.140
All right.

06:43.160 --> 06:50.930
Let's see if we can now smooth these back a bit so they don't have the artifacts and rough edges here

06:50.930 --> 06:52.010
at the end.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.810
So let's go over to the smooth tool.

06:54.830 --> 06:58.470
I'm going to hit the f key and make this a little bit bigger.

06:58.490 --> 07:05.270
Let's take this strength down a bit so we don't smooth the way all of our strokes and I'll just come

07:05.270 --> 07:11.420
in here and kind of they can drag and smooth this up just a bit.

07:11.420 --> 07:14.390
Blend these in just a little bit more like this

07:17.850 --> 07:24.550
Yeah just bring them back a little bit so they aren't quite as harsh so they aren't quite as prominent.

07:24.650 --> 07:25.070
All right.

07:25.080 --> 07:32.380
Maybe even take this down a little bit more smooth this back some like that all right.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.040
Let's give this a try.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.200
I kind of you'll like this might work.

07:38.600 --> 07:44.160
Now that we've smoothed those back let's add that micro detail I was talking about.

07:44.300 --> 07:50.570
Let's come back to the draw brush here and let's add a new texture so if I come up here I can click

07:50.570 --> 07:53.860
on texture and add new right here.

07:54.050 --> 08:01.040
Now that we have that new texture we can come over to our texture tab down here and here it is.

08:01.070 --> 08:10.100
So if we change our type from image or movie to noise now we're gonna be painting or sculpting this

08:10.400 --> 08:11.440
noise pattern.

08:11.450 --> 08:18.530
So if I come over here and click and drag you can see we get this kind of kind of a micro detail there

08:18.800 --> 08:19.760
which is kind of nice.

08:19.760 --> 08:25.430
Now let me undo this and let's turn off that smooth stroke.

08:25.430 --> 08:32.120
Also let's reduce this drink of quite a bit and I will increase the size of the brush.

08:32.120 --> 08:38.320
You can kind of see the detail here as I change the size of the brush there.

08:38.330 --> 08:38.690
All right.

08:38.710 --> 08:46.790
So let's do this let's just very lightly lay down this detail on just barely click and drag and just

08:46.790 --> 08:54.380
lay down some of this detail I'm just going to kind of do it in line with the current strokes here like

08:54.380 --> 08:55.690
this.

08:55.760 --> 08:59.060
Let's just see if we can add some of this all around.

08:59.060 --> 09:05.730
So it gives it a little bit of a feeling like it's you know textured plastic or something like that.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.040
Let's do that.

09:09.120 --> 09:17.000
All right then I'll tumble around and get this area down underneath here as well along the rim of the

09:17.000 --> 09:21.920
hair right down in here of that.

09:22.100 --> 09:25.790
Let's see how it works all right.

09:25.830 --> 09:33.750
So what I'd like to do now is bake out this high resolution information to a normal map and then we

09:33.750 --> 09:41.040
can apply the normal map to the material of the character because if I were to break out all of this

09:41.040 --> 09:48.030
detail here let me hit the Zeek and go to wireframe you can see that we've got a huge amount of polygons

09:48.030 --> 09:49.320
being used for this.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.770
We can't keep all of these polygons for a game character.

09:52.770 --> 09:57.670
We're going to need to bake the scoped information out to a normal map.

09:57.720 --> 10:01.790
So in the next video let's go ahead and work on that.
