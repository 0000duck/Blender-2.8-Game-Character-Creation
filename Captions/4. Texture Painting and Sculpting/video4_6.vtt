WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:02.480
To bake this to a normal map.

00:02.500 --> 00:07.690
We're going to have to first create a new material so let's come over here to that UVA editing tab.

00:07.840 --> 00:14.670
And currently this object still has that character material on it.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.440
Let's create a new material for the bake.

00:17.470 --> 00:20.430
Let's come over here to the materials panel.

00:20.500 --> 00:27.850
I'll hit the minus button to remove that material from this object and let's hit new and I'll just call

00:27.850 --> 00:29.270
this hair.

00:29.320 --> 00:29.770
All right.

00:29.770 --> 00:35.860
So now we need to create a texture that we're going to bake the normal map onto.

00:35.860 --> 00:42.430
So let's come over here and click new and we'll call this hair normal.

00:42.760 --> 00:47.620
And I want to make this map the same size as we did previously.

00:47.620 --> 00:53.670
So I'm just going to type in Asterix for and hit enter.

00:53.670 --> 01:00.700
So we get that fourteen ninety six so I'll just type in 40 96 here as well and then I'll click.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.350
OK all right.

01:02.370 --> 01:10.390
So here is the texture map that we're going to bake the normals to once again we've got an asterix here

01:10.390 --> 01:11.830
at the image menu.

01:11.830 --> 01:19.030
I'm going to click that and choose save as and here in the texture folder I'll save the hair normal

01:19.060 --> 01:20.140
image.

01:20.140 --> 01:24.490
And now we need to bring that image up in the here into the note editor.

01:24.490 --> 01:30.420
So let's press Shift A and we'll bring in an image texture here.

01:30.580 --> 01:37.120
Drop it there and now let's just pull this menu down and choose hair normal there OK.

01:37.210 --> 01:42.040
We don't have to connect it up or anything we can just leave it here in the note editor.

01:42.040 --> 01:45.900
Now let's come over to our render panel right here.

01:46.150 --> 01:52.780
And currently we have the IVA render engine selected and to bake a texture map currently we need to

01:52.780 --> 01:55.590
switch over to the cycles renderer.

01:55.630 --> 01:57.190
So we'll do that.

01:57.190 --> 02:04.660
Come over here and twirl down the bake arrow and let's change our bake type from combined to normal

02:05.200 --> 02:06.340
right here.

02:06.340 --> 02:06.990
All right.

02:07.030 --> 02:13.330
So now that we have this object selected we have a image texture created.

02:13.330 --> 02:21.040
And here in the note Ed I want to have this clear image checkbox checked right down here so that it

02:21.040 --> 02:24.740
clears away the black when it creates the normal map.

02:24.880 --> 02:28.360
And I think we're ready to go so let's just click bake

02:31.820 --> 02:32.480
and there it is.

02:32.480 --> 02:40.590
So if we zoom in down here you can see we've got our strokes and our micro details in there.

02:40.710 --> 02:42.700
So that looks pretty good.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.750
Now let's apply it.

02:44.820 --> 02:48.280
So what let's do is hide this.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.210
Come over here and hide it here.

02:50.220 --> 02:58.620
Let's bring back our character right here and let's apply this sculpt detail to our character material.

02:58.620 --> 03:06.030
If I click on the character here it'll switch over to the material that's on it the character and then

03:06.060 --> 03:13.410
we can come over here and add it to the note Ed. So let's press shift a bring in a new image texture

03:13.410 --> 03:16.760
node drop it here.

03:16.910 --> 03:19.580
We need to first of all save this to the hard drive.

03:19.580 --> 03:26.180
So let's go ahead and click image and save and now let's go pick it up off the hard drive.

03:26.180 --> 03:27.830
I'll click open.

03:27.830 --> 03:30.920
Go to my textures and let's click on here.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.070
Normal.

03:32.080 --> 03:37.910
There it is now let's change this from color to non color data.

03:38.320 --> 03:44.770
And then we can't just hook up this yellow color socket to this blue normal socket.

03:44.770 --> 03:48.130
We need a node in between here to transfer.

03:48.160 --> 03:56.240
So what let's do is let's press shift a again go to vector and let's choose normal map.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.440
And here we are.

03:57.460 --> 04:03.900
So now we can take this yellow color to here and the blue normal to there.

04:03.910 --> 04:10.750
Now let's come over to this window and let's switch over to the Look Dev and there we go.

04:10.750 --> 04:15.910
We can see our sculpt detail on the character.

04:15.990 --> 04:16.270
Yeah.

04:16.300 --> 04:23.080
Let's go over to the layout tab now and switch over to the Look Dev and there we go.

04:23.940 --> 04:26.250
Yeah he's looking pretty good.

04:26.310 --> 04:29.190
We've got that detail in there.

04:29.750 --> 04:32.940
And we've got the sculpt strokes in there.

04:33.820 --> 04:36.280
I think that will work just fine.

04:36.280 --> 04:41.310
In fact you know what we could go ahead and test this in unity.

04:41.350 --> 04:47.690
Why don't we open up unity and give it a try what we can do is select our character here and we can

04:47.690 --> 04:57.080
go to file and export and export FBI eggs and down here we can choose selected objects only right here

04:57.890 --> 05:07.030
and I'll create a new folder and I'll just call it exports we go and I'll put that right in here.

05:07.030 --> 05:14.620
Just as a test I'm going to hit export FCX right there and then let's go over to unity and and put this

05:14.620 --> 05:16.950
in the game engine and see how it looks.

05:17.410 --> 05:23.450
Here in unity I can come down into the assets folder here and just right click and choose important

05:23.540 --> 05:35.250
new asset I'll go into my exports and I'll choose the FBI X character their and then I will also import

05:35.280 --> 05:39.750
new assets and go into my textures folder.

05:39.900 --> 05:45.070
Select these two and import those.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.030
All right.

05:46.080 --> 05:50.010
And before I bring this in I better create a new material as well.

05:50.010 --> 05:55.290
I'm going to right click and choose create and material right here.

05:55.290 --> 06:00.210
And let's just call this Lego character.

06:00.230 --> 06:06.080
Now I can take that FBI x file and drag it over here into the hierarchy.

06:06.080 --> 06:16.500
Mary is now I can take the new material and drag it onto the character and we go and then what I can

06:16.500 --> 06:25.770
do is come over here open up the material in the inspector and let's drag in the color into the albedo

06:27.140 --> 06:34.670
and let's drag in the normal map into the normal map slot we'll click fix now to market as a normal

06:34.670 --> 06:38.080
map and we go.

06:38.230 --> 06:46.600
And let me grab the directional light here and move it up and I'll also turn it all rotated around so

06:46.600 --> 06:48.960
we can see a little bit better.

06:49.270 --> 06:51.800
And hey there we go there's our character.

06:51.850 --> 06:59.890
Now we can select this and increase the metallic a bit if we want or increase the smoothness if we want

06:59.890 --> 07:03.010
to make him a little more shiny.

07:03.010 --> 07:08.770
But yeah I think he's looking pretty good all right.

07:08.770 --> 07:15.670
So we have our character modeled and textured and we can bring him into unity and set up the material

07:15.670 --> 07:16.780
and texture.

07:16.780 --> 07:22.540
So in the next section of the course what we need to do is rig the character so we can begin to animate

07:22.540 --> 07:22.690
him.
