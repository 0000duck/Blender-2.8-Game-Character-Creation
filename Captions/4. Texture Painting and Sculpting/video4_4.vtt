WEBVTT

00:00.580 --> 00:01.010
OK.

00:01.020 --> 00:08.640
For the zipper let's go back to our texture paint mode and I'll zoom in here and once again I have just

00:08.640 --> 00:10.230
the torso selected.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.730
So that's good.

00:11.730 --> 00:15.780
You go to that front view again and let's work on this.

00:15.780 --> 00:23.670
Now let me bring back that character right here and it looks like they've just have put a few dots going

00:23.790 --> 00:27.870
up into the lapel and then down along here.

00:27.870 --> 00:30.480
So let's just try and do that as well.

00:30.540 --> 00:34.450
I'll go back to our active tool tab here.

00:34.680 --> 00:43.710
I'll scroll down and let's now create a new color I'll drag this up and I get kind of a silver ish color

00:43.710 --> 00:49.130
here Yeah let's do that.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.490
Something about like this.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.180
Let's do that.

00:52.180 --> 01:01.470
And then what I'll do is just with that fall off brush still here with on the flat shape I'll then hit

01:01.480 --> 01:04.660
the f key and bring that down quite a bit.

01:04.660 --> 01:10.290
And I just want to make little dots going all the way down here so let's just tab.

01:10.310 --> 01:12.850
No that's not strong enough.

01:13.060 --> 01:18.630
I've got this strength all the way up let me turn off the pressure sensitivity here.

01:18.850 --> 01:20.810
See if that helps.

01:20.830 --> 01:21.220
Yes.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.350
So that helps quite a bit.

01:23.360 --> 01:28.600
Me turn that down a bit or reduce the size of the brush thumb and then I'm just going to come through

01:28.600 --> 01:38.960
here and just add a little kind of a dot here just along here just to kind of hint at a zipper and I

01:38.960 --> 01:49.300
want him to kind of overlap into the black just a bit this and I'm just clicking with the brush or the

01:49.300 --> 01:50.800
pen tool I should say

01:55.260 --> 01:58.790
let's see how this looks all right.

01:58.820 --> 02:05.890
Let's zoom out and I'll go back to that object view object mode and let's see how that looks.

02:05.890 --> 02:13.270
There yeah kind of looks like a zipper I think all right.

02:13.270 --> 02:14.700
That's kind of fun.

02:14.860 --> 02:18.670
Let's use that same color for the belt buckle.

02:18.850 --> 02:22.840
But I think we're gonna have to find another color for the actual belt itself.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.240
Let's go back to texture paint.

02:25.240 --> 02:33.070
Let's hit Alt A to D like that and this time I just want to select the hips right here.

02:33.100 --> 02:34.660
Go ahead and zoom in.

02:34.810 --> 02:43.800
This go to the front view and I'd like some other color of brown here so let's see I've got this brown

02:43.800 --> 02:44.790
for the coat.

02:44.790 --> 02:45.930
Right.

02:46.080 --> 02:52.860
This Brown was the coat but maybe I could use this for the belt let me try this.

02:52.860 --> 02:57.680
I want to bring it down just a little bit more I'll save that.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.850
Let's try this.

02:58.910 --> 03:09.210
So I'll just hit the f key and bring the brush up and I'll just click and drag here and let's just paint

03:09.240 --> 03:13.640
this color right on here and you can see that there.

03:13.650 --> 03:16.260
So if that's the belt that's OK.

03:16.260 --> 03:23.340
Let's go to object mode just to see how it blends in with the other colors.

03:23.360 --> 03:23.790
All right.

03:23.810 --> 03:26.360
I think that's pretty good.

03:26.420 --> 03:33.380
I may want to do it on the top just so we don't get that bleed over on the top there.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.240
Let's go back to texture paint and see what we can do there yes.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.900
So let me just paint right up here as well.

03:39.750 --> 03:46.330
Like that OK it didn't bleed over there didn't bleed over there I think we're OK on the bottom here.

03:46.330 --> 03:48.250
That's not too bad.

03:48.310 --> 03:51.130
Let's go back to object mode and see how that looks

03:53.910 --> 03:54.410
all right.

03:54.420 --> 04:00.260
So if that's the color of the belt I feel like it needs to be a little bit darker though.

04:00.270 --> 04:01.490
Let's try that again.

04:04.980 --> 04:07.500
Let's uh go down here.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.230
Let's drag this down just a little bit more like this

04:12.870 --> 04:16.600
save that one there.

04:16.650 --> 04:18.540
Now let's come in and paint this again

04:21.800 --> 04:27.900
something like this and then let's get that top part like this.

04:27.990 --> 04:28.900
OK.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.520
Now let's go back to object mode and see how it looks.

04:32.520 --> 04:32.850
Yes.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.510
So I just wanted something a little bit a little bit darker.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.480
OK.

04:37.890 --> 04:47.640
So we go back to texture paint mode grab that one key to go to our front or the graphic.

04:47.640 --> 04:51.770
So now what I want to do is paint a belt buckle and to do that.

04:51.780 --> 04:52.980
I think what I can do.

04:53.070 --> 04:56.310
Oh I didn't save the color of the zipper.

04:56.310 --> 05:01.740
Now did I what I could do is come in here and sample it off of here.

05:01.740 --> 05:03.960
Let's do that.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.600
Click here.

05:05.810 --> 05:11.540
The eyedropper sample this and selected for the palette.

05:11.540 --> 05:12.530
There we go.

05:12.530 --> 05:18.860
So now I can make maybe the belt buckle from this although perhaps it should be a little bit darker.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.980
Let's bring it down a little bit more like that.

05:22.070 --> 05:23.540
We'll save that as well.

05:23.540 --> 05:24.790
OK.

05:24.890 --> 05:26.760
No harm done there.

05:26.780 --> 05:36.920
So now to create a belt buckle maybe I'll just expand the brush and I'll just pull straight down.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.000
Let's just try this

05:41.020 --> 05:41.590
now.

05:41.630 --> 05:42.380
Let me try again.

05:44.380 --> 05:45.950
There we go.

05:45.970 --> 05:52.390
So I just dragged straight through that to get the belt buckle and I think it's OK that that it isn't

05:52.390 --> 05:53.070
on the top.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.630
That's fine.

05:54.670 --> 05:58.510
Now we need to do the same thing for the color of the pants.

05:58.510 --> 06:03.540
So let me reduce this and let's go to the color of the pants.

06:03.550 --> 06:06.280
I think that was this one.

06:06.280 --> 06:06.610
Yeah.

06:06.610 --> 06:08.260
That looks correct.

06:08.260 --> 06:15.530
So now what let's do is create a little belt loops on the pants to do that I think I'll come up here

06:15.530 --> 06:24.620
to the cemetery and turn on X Cemetery right here and then I'll just drag straight down like this so

06:24.620 --> 06:26.960
I'm having trouble getting it straight.

06:26.960 --> 06:34.580
Let me come up and on the stroke turn on smooth stroke click there and then I'm going to click up here

06:34.580 --> 06:41.140
and drag and you can see I get this kind of tail and that might help me make things a little bit straighter.

06:41.150 --> 06:41.540
Yeah.

06:41.570 --> 06:45.770
And we go bring this down.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.780
There we go.

06:47.790 --> 06:48.060
All right.

06:48.060 --> 06:50.400
Let's see how we look in object mode.

06:54.390 --> 06:58.930
Yeah I think that's what we're looking for.

06:58.940 --> 07:04.520
All right and once again we need to save our image image save.

07:04.520 --> 07:07.010
We'll also save our blender file with control.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.650
S and there we go.

07:09.650 --> 07:12.910
We've got our textures for our Lego character.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.390
He's looking pretty cool.

07:15.860 --> 07:20.120
Let's now work on sculpting the hair.

07:20.150 --> 07:28.850
You can see if we bring up another image here actually let me go to image open and find another reference

07:28.850 --> 07:34.580
image say this one over here.

07:34.580 --> 07:41.390
You can see that he's got a bit of sculpting happening here in the hair just a couple of strokes and

07:41.390 --> 07:44.390
I'd like to go ahead and add something like that.

07:44.450 --> 07:49.550
So in the next video what let's do is begin working on sculpting the hair.
