00:00.450 --> 00:06.150
Before we go any further I see I've got an asterix here by the image menu so I'm gonna go over to the

00:06.420 --> 00:10.470
active tool panel over here and click on Save all images.

00:10.470 --> 00:12.130
OK so we've got that.

00:12.300 --> 00:16.590
We can go over to object mode and see how we're doing here.

00:16.650 --> 00:17.660
Not too bad.

00:18.420 --> 00:24.510
Let's come back over to the texture paint tools and let's work on the torso.

00:24.510 --> 00:32.670
Now I have this image of course with this guy but the clothes don't really fit what I want for the character.

00:32.670 --> 00:35.420
I found this other image online here.

00:35.430 --> 00:37.830
Let me go to the reference images.

00:37.830 --> 00:42.000
And this guy right here I kind of kind of like what they did here.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.580
This is a Lego character that someone hand painted.

00:46.590 --> 00:50.780
They actually took paint and painted right on the little toy.

00:50.940 --> 00:54.930
And I liked the little leather jacket and black t shirt here.

00:54.930 --> 00:58.540
So I think that's what I want to do for mine as well.

00:58.620 --> 01:00.690
I'm not a fan of the pants and the boots.

01:00.690 --> 01:07.800
I think I'm just going to make khaki pants and it seems like most of the Lego characters whatever the

01:07.800 --> 01:08.850
color the pants are.

01:08.850 --> 01:15.300
That's what color the feet are as well so I'm just going to make the whole thing khaki for the legs

01:15.300 --> 01:16.270
and the feet.

01:16.470 --> 01:22.360
But for the little leather jacket here let me select this.

01:22.740 --> 01:25.550
Let's with the Phil brush still selected.

01:25.550 --> 01:33.300
I've got the strength at 1.0 to come down here and click on the color swatch GRAB THE EYEDROPPER and

01:33.300 --> 01:35.160
let's find a nice color in here.

01:35.160 --> 01:35.520
Let's.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.850
Maybe it's like this.

01:37.860 --> 01:38.940
Let me try that again.

01:38.940 --> 01:43.020
Let me find something else about here a little bit different.

01:43.590 --> 01:49.910
I'm just trying to find kind of a brighter color maybe something like this.

01:49.970 --> 01:51.980
Now let's go with that.

01:51.980 --> 01:55.490
I'll click here to add it to the palette.

01:55.550 --> 01:59.660
Then let's come over here and hover over the torso.

01:59.720 --> 02:05.120
The L key the arms the L key as well.

02:05.160 --> 02:05.430
All right.

02:05.450 --> 02:10.780
So now that we've got this let's just click on the torso.

02:10.980 --> 02:15.220
Oh you can see I still had the head and hand selected as well.

02:15.230 --> 02:18.330
So let's press control Zee and undo that.

02:18.380 --> 02:26.510
Let's press Alt A to D select everything and then I'll press L for the torso and the arms.

02:26.510 --> 02:30.320
Now with that done let's then click again and there we go.

02:30.350 --> 02:33.670
So that adds it just to the torso and the arms.

02:33.680 --> 02:40.370
Now what we're gonna do is actually use these texture paint tools to paint that black T-shirt and the

02:40.370 --> 02:43.380
black lines for the jacket.

02:43.670 --> 02:51.830
And I thought we'd paint a belt and belt buckle on here too but let's get the pants colored first let's

02:52.040 --> 02:54.730
press Alt A to D select everything.

02:54.740 --> 02:57.200
Let's go over to object mode and see how we're doing.

02:57.950 --> 03:00.980
I like that but I feel like that needs to be a little bit darker.

03:00.980 --> 03:05.180
So let's let's go back to texture paint mode.

03:05.180 --> 03:13.890
Let's select that torso and arms again and I feel like this just needs to be a little bit darker.

03:14.040 --> 03:19.990
So maybe let's take this and just drag this down a bit like this.

03:20.020 --> 03:20.760
Let's try that.

03:20.770 --> 03:28.300
I'll go ahead and add this to the palette and then I'll come over here and click.

03:28.310 --> 03:30.890
Let's see how that looks in object mode.

03:30.890 --> 03:36.270
Now yeah I think that's a little bit closer to what I was imagining.

03:36.310 --> 03:37.110
OK.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.140
Let's go back to texture paint.

03:40.310 --> 03:41.850
You select everything.

03:41.950 --> 03:45.100
And now let's work on the pants here.

03:45.250 --> 03:54.380
I guess we just need to hover over these and press the L key like that and then I have yet another image.

03:54.460 --> 04:00.960
Let's open this up I have just an image of khaki pants.

04:01.250 --> 04:07.660
Let's just open this up and sample a color off of this as well.

04:07.660 --> 04:15.270
So let's come down here grab our eyedropper and I'm not sure if I want it to be this color Yeah.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.300
Let's go with this.

04:16.300 --> 04:17.320
I think that's pretty good.

04:17.320 --> 04:23.210
I'll add that to the palette click here and that adds that there.

04:23.260 --> 04:23.500
All right.

04:23.500 --> 04:27.780
Let's go back to object mode and just take a look.

04:28.100 --> 04:34.430
Yeah I think that's kind of what I want and then as I said I'm going to paint a black T-shirt and a

04:34.430 --> 04:39.250
few details for the jacket as well so there.

04:39.290 --> 04:46.610
There doesn't appear to be too many problems or issues over here on the 2D map which is good sometimes

04:46.610 --> 04:53.020
the fill brush doesn't fill everything properly but I think that's pretty good.

04:53.030 --> 04:57.940
The only thing I'd like to change maybe is this seems a little bit too bright and red.

04:57.950 --> 05:00.580
Maybe I'd like to make this just a little bit darker.

05:00.590 --> 05:08.870
So let's go back to my texture paint and I'll deselect everything hover over this.

05:08.870 --> 05:11.030
Press the El key and let's come back here.

05:11.030 --> 05:12.370
Let's select this.

05:12.550 --> 05:17.960
I'm just gonna drag down just a little bit and see if I can make this just a little bit darker and I'll

05:17.960 --> 05:20.470
click Yeah.

05:20.690 --> 05:22.040
I don't know that that helped a whole lot.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.230
Bullets try.

05:23.390 --> 05:23.720
Yeah.

05:23.730 --> 05:27.660
For some reason that was just a little bit too bright for me.

05:27.680 --> 05:35.570
Okay now I'm going to go ahead and save my blender file with control s. But then I also need to save

05:35.600 --> 05:36.920
here as well.

05:36.920 --> 05:44.150
So I've come out of texture paint mode so I don't have that save all images over here so I'll just come

05:44.150 --> 05:45.980
over here and choose.

05:46.170 --> 05:48.560
Save.

05:48.630 --> 05:48.960
All right.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.780
So that has been saved the hard drive.

05:51.780 --> 05:58.040
I've saved my blender file and I just want to also mention that I've been saving in versions.

05:58.050 --> 06:06.930
This is version 15 and I would highly suggest this as you work on any project save new versions every

06:06.930 --> 06:13.830
once in a while which you can do is just go to file save as and then you can hit the plus key on the

06:13.830 --> 06:16.800
number pad to increment the file.

06:16.830 --> 06:17.120
OK.

06:17.130 --> 06:24.840
Well now that we have our base color map created in the next video what let's do is work on actually

06:25.080 --> 06:32.460
hand painting the black t shirt the details on the leather jacket and a belt as well.

06:32.460 --> 06:40.530
But to do that I'm going to pull out my way come graphics tablet it's way come in to us pro if you're

06:40.530 --> 06:46.730
going to do any hand texture painting I really recommend getting some sort of a graphics tablet.

06:46.890 --> 06:52.080
You don't need to spend a lot of money on it and it doesn't need to be a huge tablet either something

06:52.080 --> 06:54.060
small will work just fine.

06:54.060 --> 06:58.710
But in the next video we'll begin using that to work on some more of the texture painting.
