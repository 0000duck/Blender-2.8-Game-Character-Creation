WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:05.350
Well now we're to the point in the process where we can begin adding some color to the character.

00:05.380 --> 00:08.120
Let's go back to the layout tab.

00:08.170 --> 00:11.580
And well he can't see him at all.

00:11.620 --> 00:18.580
So I think what the problem is here is if we hit the division key on the number pad we can bring him

00:18.670 --> 00:19.150
back.

00:19.150 --> 00:27.160
It looks like that in the beta version I'm using now a blender 2.8 the local mode seems to be getting

00:27.160 --> 00:30.200
kind of confused between the different tabs but that's OK.

00:30.220 --> 00:31.780
We can bring him back.

00:31.840 --> 00:38.980
Let's now go over to the shading tab and let's give this character a material at least a new material.

00:38.980 --> 00:40.110
We have one here.

00:40.120 --> 00:44.480
That's the UVA Test Pattern and although that looks pretty cool.

00:44.500 --> 00:52.120
Let's go ahead and remove it by coming over here to the materials panel and let's hit the minus button

00:52.120 --> 00:54.680
here to remove that.

00:54.700 --> 01:03.040
Let's go ahead and create a new material here and we'll just call this character let's do that.

01:03.040 --> 01:10.400
So now with this one material let's go ahead and create all the different colors using textures.

01:10.480 --> 01:14.640
So let's come over here to the texture paint tab right here.

01:14.950 --> 01:22.420
And currently you can see it's just pink because here in the texture paint tab or texture paint mode

01:22.420 --> 01:28.320
here it's going to be using a texture over here to give it color.

01:28.330 --> 01:30.760
And currently we don't have anything here.

01:30.790 --> 01:39.160
So what we need to do is add a new texture slot and that can be done right over here in this active

01:39.160 --> 01:40.240
tool tab.

01:40.240 --> 01:45.310
Now if you don't see anything over here when you click on this tab you can just come over here and maybe

01:45.310 --> 01:47.970
click on one of the texture paint buttons.

01:47.980 --> 01:51.290
And this information should pop up then.

01:51.580 --> 01:58.930
But let's go ahead and create a new texture slot or click the plus button here and we'll choose based

01:58.930 --> 01:59.890
color.

01:59.890 --> 02:00.880
There we go.

02:00.880 --> 02:04.750
Now character based color it's a pretty good name.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.510
I think I'm gonna make this texture pretty big.

02:07.510 --> 02:09.650
This currently is at 1 k.

02:09.850 --> 02:17.300
I think I'm gonna make it 4 K just because that gives me more pixels more resolution to paint on.

02:17.470 --> 02:24.430
But in the end if we ever need to take it down if we ever need to save it out as a lower resolution

02:24.430 --> 02:30.700
is to K or 1 k we can always take it into creator and save it as a new file.

02:30.700 --> 02:40.090
So here in these fields I'm just going to type in Asterix for and then hit enter and that will multiply

02:40.180 --> 02:48.210
that current number by for so we can add simple mathematic formulas in there.

02:48.460 --> 02:54.200
I'm not gonna click here and take the color all the way down to black and then I'll click.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.620
OK and there we go.

02:56.630 --> 03:00.170
So there is our texture on our character.

03:00.170 --> 03:03.660
We're then going to add the color on top of this.

03:03.680 --> 03:09.920
Let's go ahead and add that texture over here I'll pull down the menu and choose that character based

03:09.920 --> 03:13.300
color here and there it is.

03:13.540 --> 03:17.740
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to come over here to image and you see how we have an asterix

03:17.740 --> 03:18.490
here.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.730
If I click image I'm going to click save as.

03:21.730 --> 03:28.810
And we can save this image right here to the harddrive because currently the way blender handles 2D

03:28.840 --> 03:29.550
images.

03:29.590 --> 03:32.220
This hasn't yet been saved to the hard drive.

03:32.290 --> 03:34.090
It's in memory.

03:34.090 --> 03:40.690
But even if we save blender and then close out of Blender this will still just go away.

03:40.690 --> 03:48.100
So we need to come over here to image save as and I'm going to take it into my textures folder that

03:48.100 --> 03:54.730
I've created and character based color once again is a pretty good name for it and I'll click save as

03:54.740 --> 03:56.080
image.

03:56.080 --> 03:56.340
All right.

03:56.350 --> 04:01.870
So now you can see there's no Asterix here by the image menu and that's good.

04:01.870 --> 04:08.200
That means we've saved it to the hard drive and from now on we can just click this button over here

04:08.200 --> 04:09.640
to save the image.

04:09.640 --> 04:15.160
But we needed to go through that process to save it to the drive initially.

04:15.160 --> 04:15.800
All right.

04:15.880 --> 04:23.950
So let's bring in a reference image right over here I'm a click and drag and bring in an image or create

04:23.950 --> 04:25.300
an image editor.

04:25.630 --> 04:32.890
We have the UVA map here so let's click view and uncheck display texture paint you these.

04:33.110 --> 04:40.210
And we go now go to image and open and let's go find in our reference images.

04:40.210 --> 04:50.300
This guy right here so I just want to sample the hair color and the head color for our texture map here.

04:50.370 --> 04:56.100
So I'm going to hit the one key to go to the front view just because I think it's easier to work like

04:56.100 --> 04:56.800
this.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.150
And I'm just going to fill these colors.

04:59.160 --> 05:05.550
So for the yellow and the brown I just want to fill the colors to get just the base colors applied.

05:05.850 --> 05:12.510
So let's begin with the hair here what I'm gonna do is I'm a select this guy right here this face selection

05:12.690 --> 05:14.520
masking I'm going to click that.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.910
And then what I want to do is d select everything.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.160
So many press Alt A and that D selects everything.

05:20.160 --> 05:25.050
So we had everything selected before when we turned this on.

05:25.050 --> 05:33.000
Now we can do is hover over a piece of the model and push the L key and that will select just that piece

05:33.660 --> 05:34.230
and we go.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.700
So now what I want to do is fill this to do that.

05:38.720 --> 05:43.050
I want to come over to the fill tool right here but there we go.

05:43.050 --> 05:49.020
I want to take the strength up to 100 percent so we can do that here or over here.

05:49.050 --> 05:51.340
I'll go in and click and drag there.

05:51.390 --> 05:58.860
We want to sample our color so going to scroll down here and I'll click on the color swatch here and

05:58.860 --> 06:05.550
then I'll click on the eyedropper right here and let's sample this color maybe right here you can see

06:05.550 --> 06:06.490
it there.

06:06.630 --> 06:12.360
Now in case I want to go back to this color so I don't lose it when I choose another color.

06:12.360 --> 06:16.470
I'm going to twirl the color palette thing down here.

06:16.470 --> 06:19.920
Click new and create a new color palette.

06:19.920 --> 06:24.870
Now I can hit the plus and it will be saved right there.

06:24.870 --> 06:25.470
So that's good.

06:25.470 --> 06:26.780
That's what we want.

06:26.780 --> 06:34.080
Now let's come over here with that Phil brush selected and just click on the hair and there we go.

06:34.110 --> 06:40.980
Now we've got our color applied just to the hair and you can see it come in to the 2D image over here

06:40.980 --> 06:41.970
as well.

06:41.970 --> 06:42.230
All right.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.350
So we have the hair done.

06:43.350 --> 06:49.110
Let's go ahead and scroll up and click save all images and that takes away the Asterix from the image

06:49.410 --> 06:51.200
menu there.

06:51.260 --> 06:59.660
I'm going to pass out a to D select and also let's just go over to object mode here and go over to our

07:00.080 --> 07:06.850
look div here and we can see the hair color the way we have it currently.

07:06.910 --> 07:08.850
Yeah that looks pretty good.

07:08.890 --> 07:20.110
So let's go back to texture paint mode here and with our face selection still on let's come over here

07:20.110 --> 07:27.520
and hover over the head at the El key and you can see here now even though I selected the head it didn't

07:27.520 --> 07:28.680
select all of it.

07:28.810 --> 07:33.510
And that's because we created seams when we did the movie map.

07:33.610 --> 07:40.030
So if I hit the tab key here in edit mode you can see all of the seams and now that we're all done with

07:40.030 --> 07:44.360
the movie map we can take away these seams without any problem.

07:44.560 --> 07:50.600
So let's press the A key and then press control e and let's choose clear seam.

07:50.860 --> 07:52.390
And there we go.

07:52.390 --> 08:00.610
So now if we go back to texture paint I'll just hit the tab key and now what let's do is hover over

08:00.730 --> 08:01.420
the head.

08:01.420 --> 08:04.970
Press the L key and you can see it selects the whole head.

08:04.970 --> 08:09.350
And let's go ahead and press all over the two hands as well there.

08:09.730 --> 08:16.000
And now with the Phil brush still selected Let's scroll down here.

08:16.270 --> 08:17.770
Oh I lost my image here.

08:17.770 --> 08:22.500
Let me pull the menu down and select that image again.

08:22.510 --> 08:23.590
There we go.

08:23.590 --> 08:30.970
Let me select the color swatch the eyedropper and select this yellow color right here.

08:31.150 --> 08:34.030
I'll add it to the palette right there.

08:34.030 --> 08:39.950
And then let's come over here and just click on the head and that adds that there.

08:39.990 --> 08:40.710
All right.

08:40.780 --> 08:47.980
So there we've got the beginnings of our color map in the next video we'll continue on with the rest

08:47.980 --> 08:48.460
of the body.
