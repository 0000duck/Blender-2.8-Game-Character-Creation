00:00.770 --> 00:07.430
First of all let's go back into our texture paint mode right here and I will go ahead and make sure

00:07.430 --> 00:11.740
everything's d selected and then I'll just select the torso and the arms.

00:11.740 --> 00:18.050
Actually I don't even need the arms I'm just going to select the torso and that's all I need for this.

00:18.050 --> 00:20.310
I'll go to that front view again.

00:20.310 --> 00:21.040
And here we go.

00:21.040 --> 00:24.200
We'll work in this view here.

00:24.200 --> 00:32.050
Now we should be able to see as we paint the paint strokes come up over here on the 2d image as well.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.070
So what let's do is go over to the draw brush right here.

00:36.110 --> 00:40.730
Our strength is currently at point seven I'm gonna go and take it up to one point oh let's see how that

00:40.730 --> 00:46.070
works and I'd like to come over here and turn off the X mirror.

00:46.070 --> 00:52.010
I want to be able to just paint on one side or the other and I don't want it to appear symmetrically

00:52.040 --> 00:53.950
on both sides.

00:53.950 --> 01:03.320
Also I can change the fall off of the stroke here from kind of a soft fall off to a sharp brush.

01:03.320 --> 01:08.590
Let's take a look at the difference of those here before I make a decision on that.

01:08.900 --> 01:11.690
Let's bring up that image again over here.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.870
So here's that image right there.

01:15.200 --> 01:20.630
And let's go ahead and come down here and let's create kind of a black colour.

01:20.630 --> 01:25.420
I'll just grab this and drag it all the way down maybe not all the way down.

01:25.680 --> 01:29.490
Give it a little bit of color just a tad bit like this.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.550
There we go.

01:30.550 --> 01:31.770
Something like that.

01:31.830 --> 01:35.050
I'll go ahead and add that to the palette as well.

01:35.280 --> 01:44.910
And then I'll grab my graphics pen and tablet here and if I hit the f key I can change the size of the

01:44.910 --> 01:46.080
brush here.

01:46.440 --> 01:51.170
And if I press shift F I can change the strength of the stroke.

01:51.180 --> 01:53.070
I'm going to keep it at 1 4 now.

01:53.070 --> 01:55.300
So here is the stroke.

01:55.320 --> 02:02.700
If I keep that fall off as it is right here then let me switch to this and here's the stroke.

02:03.270 --> 02:04.810
If I have no fall off.

02:05.400 --> 02:11.760
So I actually think I may go with this here with no ball off at all.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.670
I mean take the brush down a bit and we go.

02:15.670 --> 02:20.860
And so for this it looks like it looks like there are a couple of things going on here.

02:20.860 --> 02:25.120
Looks like we've got a a line over here for a seam underneath the arm.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.030
I don't think I want this to go on the sides.

02:28.030 --> 02:31.060
I just wanted to be on the front and that's it.

02:31.060 --> 02:40.960
So what I think I'll do is just begin here and create these lapel type pieces here and here and then

02:40.960 --> 02:43.420
I'll work on the pockets I guess.

02:43.420 --> 02:43.770
All right.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.030
So let's let's try this.

02:46.030 --> 02:52.960
I'm going to begin with this part that borders the black t shirt so I'll just begin and I'll draw down

02:52.960 --> 02:56.920
to here and I'll come out like this.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.320
This maybe.

02:58.690 --> 03:00.310
Now let me controls that.

03:00.340 --> 03:06.800
Let me try that again I might take the brush down just a little bit more like this.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.560
Let's try this

03:11.020 --> 03:15.350
and then come over here like this.

03:15.350 --> 03:20.770
Maybe we go like this now I want to press controls again and try it again.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.660
Yeah something like that

03:28.310 --> 03:29.020
like that.

03:29.030 --> 03:29.540
There we go.

03:29.540 --> 03:32.040
I like that a little bit better.

03:32.120 --> 03:38.180
So now for these pieces for the lapels I'll just come over here.

03:38.200 --> 03:43.950
This and then kind of loop that down now.

03:44.260 --> 03:45.250
Let me try that again.

03:45.820 --> 03:49.750
Maybe I'll shrink that down just a bit like this.

03:49.750 --> 03:50.400
Let's try this.

03:50.400 --> 04:00.950
Now this year and then I'll swoop that down like this and we go yeah okay.

04:01.050 --> 04:06.350
That works a little bit better for this side here.

04:06.390 --> 04:16.510
Let's try this Miss then I'm going to come down like that and then I'm gonna add a couple of silver

04:16.630 --> 04:19.170
dots for the zipper as well.

04:20.300 --> 04:20.560
All right.

04:20.570 --> 04:22.730
So we have those.

04:22.730 --> 04:26.220
Let's now work on the little pockets here.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.240
So it looks like it's something like this

04:33.830 --> 04:42.560
here with a little circle and then I'll just come straight down.

04:42.680 --> 04:43.370
Yes.

04:43.530 --> 04:46.800
Maybe we could add a little thing like that.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.090
All right let's try it over here.

04:50.070 --> 04:53.310
Um like this

04:57.160 --> 04:58.000
little circle

05:03.130 --> 05:05.190
something like that.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.410
All right.

05:06.420 --> 05:08.500
It looks a little bit off.

05:08.500 --> 05:19.680
Let me uh I'm done like this try that all right it looks very hand drawn.

05:20.210 --> 05:27.820
So if I want to erase some of this what I can do is I can just come back and use this same color.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.750
So let's say I grab this.

05:29.750 --> 05:35.510
Here and then increase the size of the brush.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.760
And then I can come in and paint this out

05:41.020 --> 05:42.250
like this.

05:42.250 --> 05:53.180
Let me zoom in here I can just paint this out with the brown color and then go back to the black reduce

05:53.190 --> 05:58.680
the sides of the brush again and then maybe make this a little bit smaller.

05:58.690 --> 06:01.210
Let's try this again and bring that down

06:07.880 --> 06:09.080
here we go.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.680
Something like that.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.280
Then let's add a couple of these lines coming down and I guess or like creases.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.180
Let's do that

06:22.000 --> 06:24.440
we go all right.

06:24.470 --> 06:27.670
So we have the beginnings of our jacket here.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.760
Let's go to the top.

06:28.790 --> 06:36.830
We can't really see the top and what they did there but we can kind of add some lines to ours up here

06:36.830 --> 06:45.290
so maybe I could increase the size of the brush here and just kind of extend this back to the neck there

06:45.620 --> 06:54.860
and maybe extend this back like this and then maybe I'll reduce the brush is just a bit and extend this

06:54.860 --> 07:01.550
back as well and maybe extend this back here like that.

07:01.660 --> 07:02.590
All right.

07:02.740 --> 07:05.800
So now let's try and fill in the shirt here.

07:05.800 --> 07:12.760
I'm just going to color in everything in between these two lines here and you can see it coming in over

07:12.760 --> 07:20.050
here on the 2d image map as well we probably need to click on Save images here pretty soon to make sure

07:20.050 --> 07:22.980
we get this all on our color map.

07:23.110 --> 07:28.600
And don't lose all of the work we've done here so I will go ahead and do that.

07:28.650 --> 07:29.850
I'll scroll back up here.

07:29.860 --> 07:32.680
Click on Save all images.

07:32.710 --> 07:33.800
There we go.

07:33.820 --> 07:42.520
Just to make sure and then let's come up here and do the same thing on the top kind of simulate the

07:42.760 --> 07:45.170
top of the coat there.

07:45.190 --> 07:53.340
Now we could also if there's any problems we can always come over here and paint here on the 2d image

07:53.350 --> 08:00.470
if on the paint mode right here you can come in here and just paint right in here and kind of clean

08:00.470 --> 08:07.520
this up a bit if we want like that so let's go in and take a look at this in object mode.

08:07.530 --> 08:19.820
Now we go we can see it's beginning to take shape we could go over to the materials panel and we could

08:19.820 --> 08:25.910
take the secular down just a bit like yes we wanted to.

08:26.060 --> 08:26.450
All right.

08:26.470 --> 08:33.470
So in the next video what let's do is work on creating the zipper and we'll create a belt for the character

08:33.470 --> 08:33.920
as well.
