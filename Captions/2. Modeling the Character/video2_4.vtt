WEBVTT

00:00.760 --> 00:04.090
For the arms I think we can begin with a cylinder again.

00:04.360 --> 00:10.190
We can maybe press shift a and bring in a cylinder.

00:10.360 --> 00:17.650
I need to change this to 16 sides I think and let's go ahead and create a triangle band for the caps

00:17.650 --> 00:26.080
again and then I'd like to rotate this around the x axis so I'll press our x 9 0 and spin that and let's

00:26.170 --> 00:30.830
shrink it down and kind of put it in place and see how big we need this.

00:30.940 --> 00:39.610
I'll just bring it over here and if we take a look at the reference image here it looks like it's kind

00:39.610 --> 00:45.930
of hard to tell but it looks like we might be able to place it about like this alternate in the x axis.

00:46.100 --> 00:54.620
Gamma press are an X and then just rotate or move the mouse and maybe get it about like this.

00:54.620 --> 01:03.080
It's kind of hard to tell but I think that might be about the proper placement for this we can of course

01:03.080 --> 01:05.230
move it around as we need to.

01:05.240 --> 01:13.430
But now let's hit the period key to zoom in and once we've zoomed into this object we also tumble around

01:13.430 --> 01:14.750
it as well.

01:14.750 --> 01:23.480
I'll tab into edit mode hit three key for base mode and let's press the C key again and click and drag

01:23.480 --> 01:25.160
to select those.

01:25.160 --> 01:30.620
Think I'll just delete these because we're not going to need these right now I'll hit X and I'll choose

01:30.620 --> 01:34.130
to delete faces and we go.

01:34.350 --> 01:39.860
Now if I hit the two key to go to edge mode I'll press Alt and click an edge and that will select that

01:39.860 --> 01:41.480
whole edge loop.

01:41.480 --> 01:48.380
Now let's go to the side view with the three key and let's try and extrude this out and bring it up

01:48.380 --> 01:51.320
to where the shoulders should be.

01:51.380 --> 01:57.110
But before I do that I mean move this down a bit and turn it some because I feel like trying to get

01:57.110 --> 02:01.690
it up to the center of the torso from there may have been kind of a challenge.

02:01.910 --> 02:02.170
All right.

02:02.200 --> 02:08.990
So what let's do is here in the side view I'm in the right or the graphic view I'm just gonna hit E

02:09.350 --> 02:16.790
and then click and I'll hit g to grab that and move this back a bit and then I'm gonna hit R and rotate

02:16.790 --> 02:20.500
it and then G and kind of spin it around like this.

02:20.530 --> 02:28.370
So I'm just trying to turn it so that we can point the next extrusion up toward the shoulder here I'll

02:28.370 --> 02:37.750
hit E and then click and hit G and move this up like this and hit R and turn it like this all right.

02:37.780 --> 02:44.570
So now we've got that kind of 3 edge bend here so I want to show you what I mean.

02:44.570 --> 02:53.260
This edge here this edge right here and this edge right here those three edges for that bend all right.

02:53.290 --> 02:59.680
So now if I take this edge I'm going to extrude it up but I'm not going to go all the way I'm going

02:59.680 --> 03:03.140
to hit e and just bring it up right about to here.

03:03.140 --> 03:10.240
Let's say and now we need to get this curved part of the shoulder and I think the way to do that is

03:10.240 --> 03:12.160
going to be a sphere.

03:12.160 --> 03:15.140
So what I'd like to do is create a sphere.

03:15.220 --> 03:19.790
Cut it in half and then connect it up with the upper arm.

03:19.810 --> 03:25.120
Now when I'm in object mode I can right click and go to the snap menu here.

03:25.120 --> 03:31.890
But when I'm in edit mode the right click brings up the context menu or whatever.

03:31.930 --> 03:33.340
Select mode where m.

03:33.340 --> 03:35.740
So we're in Edge mode right now.

03:35.740 --> 03:42.460
So the edge context menu comes up so to move the cursor while we're on edge mode we can press shift

03:42.550 --> 03:47.550
s and now we can choose cursor to selected right there.

03:47.620 --> 03:53.420
And now I'll tab back into object mode and let's create a sphere up here.

03:53.620 --> 03:59.860
I'll press shift a and I'll go to mesh you v sphere.

03:59.860 --> 04:10.600
Now we need to change the number of segments from 32 to 16 right here and that will match the number

04:10.600 --> 04:12.460
of edges of our cylinder.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.760
So let's scale this down a bit.

04:15.600 --> 04:21.780
And then what I'll do is go ahead and maybe just go to the well I'll go to the side view here with three

04:21.780 --> 04:30.780
key and I'll hit the Z key to go to wireframe and let's tab in the edit mode I'll press the three key

04:30.780 --> 04:39.110
to go to face select and then what we can do is go ahead and select all the faces on the bottom here.

04:39.120 --> 04:46.320
So I'll click the select tool and then I'll click and drag and select all of these hit X and delete

04:46.680 --> 04:47.870
bases.

04:47.910 --> 04:49.260
There we go.

04:49.260 --> 04:49.620
All right.

04:49.650 --> 04:52.780
So now let's shrink this down a bit.

04:54.230 --> 04:57.410
And let's also move this up to where it should be.

04:57.410 --> 05:01.030
Maybe right up in here let's say.

05:01.100 --> 05:05.540
OK so now what we need to do is connect these up.

05:05.540 --> 05:13.850
Let's go ahead and join these together I'll select the arm and shift select the shoulder object here

05:13.880 --> 05:16.410
and then I'll press control J.

05:16.460 --> 05:23.240
And that will join those all into one object then I'll tab and edit mode and now we can connect these

05:23.240 --> 05:30.920
up what we could do is let me just select these bases here I'm going to also click on an edge between

05:30.920 --> 05:39.860
two of the faces and then I'll hit X and delete bases and then back to edge mode all click this edge

05:40.420 --> 05:43.980
all shift click this edge so we select them both.

05:44.060 --> 05:51.390
And now let's bridge this so we could come up here to the edge menu here and choose bridge edge loops.

05:51.440 --> 05:58.870
We can also press control e and we get the same menu we can select bridge edge loops here and then we

05:58.870 --> 06:02.710
go and that connects those two edges together.

06:02.800 --> 06:07.180
Now I feel like this cylinder kind of should be turned a bit.

06:07.180 --> 06:14.710
So let's under this control Zee and I'll select this top part with the L key I'm going to d select everything

06:14.710 --> 06:20.620
and hit the L key and that selects all linked components of that particular piece.

06:20.650 --> 06:28.210
So let's just take this and rotate it and kind of point it at the elbow there and let's also select

06:28.360 --> 06:35.360
this edge and maybe I'll shrink it down just a bit as well and move it kind of get it more in line and

06:35.380 --> 06:40.250
just feel like we were kind of off when we connected those together.

06:40.330 --> 06:40.570
All right.

06:40.570 --> 06:46.090
So now with this edge selected I'll press all shift and click that edge and let's try it again.

06:46.090 --> 06:50.190
I'll press control e and bridge edge loops all right.

06:50.220 --> 06:52.370
So I think that's a little bit better.

06:52.470 --> 06:58.650
I mean select this edge and or scale it out a bit maybe move it some I can come over here to the move

06:58.650 --> 07:06.780
tool and kind of click and drag and move that maybe I can select this edge now kind of turn it move

07:06.780 --> 07:06.900
it.

07:06.930 --> 07:13.680
So now we can come in and begin rearranging the edges to get it just the way we want it.

07:13.770 --> 07:16.110
Maybe I'll turn that a bit here.

07:16.130 --> 07:17.700
Something like that.

07:17.700 --> 07:21.650
So just trying to get that general shape.

07:21.720 --> 07:21.960
All right.

07:21.960 --> 07:27.120
We should take a look at it from the front and view as well and it looks to me like we've got a couple

07:27.120 --> 07:31.290
of these edges that are a little too wide or a little too narrow.

07:31.290 --> 07:38.010
So if I pressed S and X maybe I could bring this in a bit and maybe select this edge and press X and

07:38.010 --> 07:40.430
X and bring it out just a bit.

07:40.630 --> 07:49.390
So you may need to do just a little bit of tweaking here and also now I may actually take this part

07:49.490 --> 07:55.270
right here and it feels like I could shrink that down just a little bit like this.

07:55.460 --> 07:58.420
All right let's go with this for now and see how it works.

07:59.260 --> 08:06.190
Right now the pivot point of this object is right here in the the what was the center of the cylinder

08:07.420 --> 08:13.770
I could move this or change this if I needed to to move and rotate the arm.

08:13.870 --> 08:20.920
So if I tabbed into edit mode and all clicked say this edge let me press the two key to go to edge mode

08:20.950 --> 08:23.380
and then there we go.

08:23.380 --> 08:30.760
Now I could press shift s move the cursor to the selected and then I could set the origin of the object

08:30.790 --> 08:32.050
to that 3d cursor.

08:32.050 --> 08:36.180
Now we're already pretty close to being there but I'll go ahead and do that.

08:36.520 --> 08:43.780
I can right click and edit mode and go to set origin and set the origin of the object to the 3d cursor.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.190
And there we go.

08:45.190 --> 08:45.480
OK.

08:45.490 --> 08:54.410
So now what I can do is maybe move this in like this and then tilt it out.

08:54.560 --> 08:59.420
I'll just push the arc key and kind of tilt it out like this.

08:59.450 --> 09:05.390
Now let's go ahead and smooth this the way we have the other objects are selected and come up here to

09:05.900 --> 09:14.330
object and shade smooth or as we've done before we can come over here and right click it and choose

09:14.750 --> 09:16.860
shade smooth here as well.

09:16.860 --> 09:17.910
There we go.

09:17.930 --> 09:18.200
OK.

09:18.230 --> 09:23.870
So now let's take a look at that object data panel right down here.

09:23.870 --> 09:27.890
We'll go to the normals section right here.

09:27.890 --> 09:34.650
Turn on auto smooth and let's go and drag it all the way down and then drag it back up and see what

09:34.650 --> 09:36.660
we can get.

09:36.830 --> 09:44.930
At what point it kind of smooths out or is the way we want it to Yeah it looks like above 30 degrees

09:45.440 --> 09:49.270
you can see it kind of sharpen up at the elbow there.

09:49.280 --> 09:55.640
But then if I drag it up say above 35 degrees that kind of smooths out a bit.

09:55.640 --> 10:03.020
And once again we are creating this for a game character so we're trying to keep it fairly low poly

10:03.050 --> 10:04.000
here.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.040
I think I'll tilt it again in the y here.

10:06.080 --> 10:12.830
Let me push r and y and tilted in the Y and I'm gonna push it in again like this and see how that works

10:13.630 --> 10:20.180
I'm gonna get the cursor back to the center of the grid by pressing shift C and that frames everything

10:20.180 --> 10:27.180
up and puts the cursor back at the grid and I think we're doing pretty well here.

10:27.320 --> 10:34.340
I'm going to select the torso now and hit the period key and frame that up so it spins around the torso.

10:34.340 --> 10:36.350
Yeah I think that works pretty well.

10:36.350 --> 10:40.990
I may want to add an edge in here.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.380
In between each of these so it curves a little bit more.

10:44.390 --> 10:47.420
But for now I think I'm gonna leave it as is.

10:47.660 --> 10:52.720
And in the next video what let's do is work on creating the hand.

10:52.880 --> 10:58.580
And then after that what we'll do is we'll mirror these over and see how it looks.

10:58.610 --> 10:59.940
So that's coming up next.
