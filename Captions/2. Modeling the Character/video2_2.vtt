00:00.580 --> 00:04.090
For the torso I think all we'll need is a cube.

00:04.090 --> 00:12.210
So let's press Shift A and go to mesh cube and I'll hit the Z key and go to wireframe.

00:12.230 --> 00:14.110
Now let's try and put this in place.

00:14.110 --> 00:22.260
I think I'll just drag it straight up and let's scale it down until we get it about the right width

00:22.860 --> 00:25.590
for the base of the object right down here.

00:25.590 --> 00:32.190
I just want to get it about the right width here and that that doesn't look too bad.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.690
Let's get it right about there okay.

00:34.900 --> 00:40.650
Now we just need to bring this down and scale it in so I'll tab into edit mode.

00:40.690 --> 00:46.670
I'll hit the three key to go to base mode and I'll just select that face right up here.

00:46.690 --> 00:47.910
There it is.

00:48.020 --> 00:54.850
Go back to the front view and I'll just with the move tool enabled over here I'll just click and drag

00:54.880 --> 01:04.070
and drag it down to here and then we can scale it in the X by pressing X and X and then pulling in like

01:04.070 --> 01:08.510
this and we go okay.

01:08.540 --> 01:10.520
So now we have it like this.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.010
It's a little too wide.

01:12.020 --> 01:21.140
So let's tab back into edit mode it the Z key go to solid view and now it's scale and the Y I'll hit

01:21.140 --> 01:27.050
the three key to go to the side view and we can come over here and just click the scale tool and then

01:27.050 --> 01:35.570
click and drag on the y axis right here and I think it's usually about this wide it's kind of hard to

01:35.570 --> 01:42.830
tell exactly how wide this should be from our front view image you can kind of bring that in like this.

01:42.830 --> 01:44.830
I think that'll work pretty well.

01:44.840 --> 01:51.770
Let's go back to the front view and now we need I think another cube for the hips here for the belt

01:52.040 --> 01:56.720
so let's press shift a mesh cube at the Z key.

01:56.730 --> 02:03.710
Go to wireframe and I'll click on the move tool over here and let's just click and drag and I'm going

02:03.710 --> 02:10.220
to put the center of this cube right in the center of the belt buckle right there and hit s and scale

02:10.220 --> 02:14.360
down until we're about the right width apart like that.

02:14.360 --> 02:22.730
Now the scale in the Zi I'll hit s and z and move the mouse down until we get it about the right height

02:22.880 --> 02:24.420
about like that.

02:24.660 --> 02:25.600
There we go.

02:25.670 --> 02:29.030
Now once again we need to change the width in the Y.

02:29.060 --> 02:36.440
So let's come over here to the side view again and let's press x and y and then we can move that in

02:36.440 --> 02:37.600
like this.

02:37.610 --> 02:38.150
There we go

02:41.260 --> 02:48.490
and now that we have these fairly nice rounded curves up here on the head these very sharp angles on

02:48.490 --> 02:52.210
the torso just seem to be a little bit too much actually.

02:52.450 --> 02:57.090
In fact we don't want to do is let's let's bring in another reference image.

02:57.100 --> 03:01.870
I'm going to click and drag this and then hover right over here on the corner of that window and tell

03:02.020 --> 03:07.550
the cursor turns to a cross then I'm going to click and drag down to create a new window.

03:07.840 --> 03:12.340
And in here I'm going to change to an image editor.

03:12.340 --> 03:17.500
So now we have an image editor in this window and we can bring in a new image.

03:17.500 --> 03:26.630
I'll go to image open and let's go to that folder and in here under reference images.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.270
Let's click here so we can see it.

03:29.270 --> 03:31.330
I've got this one right here.

03:31.370 --> 03:35.960
This is kind of a three quarter view so we can kind of get a sense of how it looks at a slightly different

03:36.050 --> 03:37.050
angle.

03:37.070 --> 03:39.740
I'll bring that in by clicking open image.

03:39.740 --> 03:40.400
And there we go.

03:40.400 --> 03:48.890
We can scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in or out and you can see here right in here the edges of the

03:48.890 --> 03:53.000
torso have kind of a a rounded feel to them.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.670
So I think we could maybe add that here as well with the beveled tool again.

03:58.670 --> 04:02.360
So let's select that torso and tab and edit mode.

04:02.540 --> 04:08.110
I'll hit the two key to go to edge mode and I'm just going to hit the A key to select all of the edges.

04:08.150 --> 04:09.410
Now that we've done that.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.650
Let's go ahead and Bevel this.

04:11.660 --> 04:18.150
I'll press control B and I'll drag the mouse out just a little bit.

04:18.200 --> 04:24.350
Now I'm seeing a couple of issues here one we've got two mini segments I think we don't need that many

04:24.680 --> 04:33.230
segments and two I feel like the curve we're getting here isn't exactly proportional or centered on

04:33.230 --> 04:34.230
that edge.

04:34.430 --> 04:40.670
And I think the reason why if we get the in key here and tab back into object mode you can see that

04:40.670 --> 04:49.640
the scale is off and tools like the bevel tool are affected by our scale here for the object.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.260
Well let's do it.

04:50.390 --> 04:56.590
Let me just press control Z and let's undo a bit and then I'm going to tab back into object mode and

04:56.600 --> 05:04.130
let's try applying the scale and doing this again I'll press control a to bring up the apply menu and

05:04.130 --> 05:10.150
then I'm just going to apply the scale and what that does is it changes all of these two ones.

05:10.160 --> 05:16.880
And it says to blender that this new size and shape of the object is the default scale of the object

05:16.880 --> 05:18.050
now.

05:18.080 --> 05:25.700
So now if we tab back into edit mode with all the edges still selected we'll press control B and drag

05:25.730 --> 05:32.270
out a bit and it's a little bit tough to tell but you see how this curve now is a little more centered

05:32.450 --> 05:35.060
and proportional on the edge.

05:35.090 --> 05:37.040
So that's all I wanted there.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.810
Now do we need four segments.

05:38.810 --> 05:42.020
We can take it down to three and see how it how it looks.

05:42.020 --> 05:43.310
Let's try that.

05:43.340 --> 05:45.990
I'll go back to object mode with tab key.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.150
And how does it look at it.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.300
I think it looks pretty good.

05:49.310 --> 05:52.750
But we we probably need to do a little more smoothing again.

05:52.780 --> 06:00.350
I mean at the end to close that panel and then I'll right click and choose shade smooth and let's see

06:00.360 --> 06:05.430
that looks pretty good just straight out of the box as it were.

06:05.830 --> 06:10.710
I'm going to come down here to the normals section and turn on auto smooth.

06:10.710 --> 06:17.120
You can drag all the way down and then drag back up and see what we can get here yeah.

06:17.130 --> 06:22.670
It looks like that's about what we want right there.

06:22.870 --> 06:28.970
OK so now maybe we can go back to the front view and create this cylinder here.

06:29.170 --> 06:34.780
Now it's kind of cutting up into the hips right in here I don't know if you can see that.

06:34.780 --> 06:37.540
I might need to find another image here.

06:37.540 --> 06:44.290
Let's go back see if I can find another image that'll show how it's being cut in.

06:44.290 --> 06:47.360
Let me open this one here yes.

06:47.370 --> 06:55.110
So you can see here just a little bit how the leg kind of cuts into that hips area right there so we're

06:55.110 --> 07:02.520
gonna need to do a boolean for that but before we do let's go ahead and create this center cylinder

07:02.580 --> 07:13.730
and we'll then use this to create that boolean cut the press shift a and bring in a cylinder we've got

07:13.750 --> 07:18.950
it at sixteen sides with a triangle fan that's probably just fine.

07:18.950 --> 07:27.620
I'm going to go back to wireframe with the Z key and I want to turn this now 90 degrees in the y axis.

07:27.680 --> 07:33.320
If I hit the end key to open up the sidebar you can see if I click and drag in the y axis.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.170
This is the way I want to turn it like this.

07:36.170 --> 07:44.060
So if I just press controls ze I can go back to where it was but what I want to do is press are 9 0

07:44.090 --> 07:49.960
and that will rotate the object 90 degrees based on my viewport here.

07:49.970 --> 07:56.180
Now if I hit the escape key and go back to here what I can do is tumble around here and if I do this

07:56.180 --> 08:02.060
again here in the 3D view watch what happens are 9 0 and hit enter.

08:02.060 --> 08:05.200
It turns once again based on the viewport.

08:05.210 --> 08:07.580
So let's control Z that.

08:07.610 --> 08:16.400
So if I were in this viewport here and I wanted to turn it I could press r y 9 0 and now it'll turn

08:16.400 --> 08:24.070
in the y axis as if we're in this view let's it s and I'll scale that down quite a bit and then I'll

08:24.070 --> 08:28.780
hit S and X and scale it in.

08:28.870 --> 08:36.900
Let's bring that up and see if we can get it to be about the right size maybe about like this.

08:36.930 --> 08:41.250
So it cuts up into that hips area just a bit.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.050
I mean make it a little bit bigger.

08:43.050 --> 08:44.650
Bring this up some.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.700
So that is I think about what we want.

08:47.700 --> 08:54.090
Let me hit the Z key and go to solid view.

08:54.150 --> 08:59.730
I'm just taking a look and seeing if that's big enough small enough.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.070
Actually you know what I think.

09:01.080 --> 09:06.010
I'd like to do is make this just a little bit bigger.

09:06.040 --> 09:10.510
Let's go back to that front view and push it up just a little bit farther.

09:10.840 --> 09:17.600
And then I'll scale it in the X with S and X until it's just about like this and here we go.

09:17.600 --> 09:27.260
I just wanted to be able to cut up into this piece and also to not have a cut at an edge so I don't

09:27.260 --> 09:32.000
want to make that cut right at this edge or right at this edge.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.890
I want to have the cut happen between them.

09:35.890 --> 09:40.700
You see how I've got this edge right here above here.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.870
That's what I want.

09:42.880 --> 09:43.240
All right.

09:43.270 --> 09:48.910
So in the next video what let's do is we'll use this object.

09:48.910 --> 09:54.670
We will duplicate it and use it to make that curved cut into the belt here.
