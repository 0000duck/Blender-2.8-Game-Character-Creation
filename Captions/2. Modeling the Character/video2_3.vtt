00:00.700 --> 00:07.030
Before we begin using the boolean tool I think what I'd like to do is do a little cleanup and name our

00:07.030 --> 00:07.840
objects.

00:07.840 --> 00:12.000
It'll help as we go through the process of using our boolean modifier.

00:12.010 --> 00:16.510
So I'm going to select the head here and over here.

00:16.510 --> 00:17.470
Here it's selected.

00:17.470 --> 00:21.190
I'll just double click here and let's call that head.

00:21.190 --> 00:27.850
This one here will be our tour so let's go ahead and call it that.

00:27.870 --> 00:29.140
No I misspelled it.

00:29.140 --> 00:30.910
Let's try that again.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.530
Here we go.

00:32.530 --> 00:38.070
This will call the hits and we go.

00:38.510 --> 00:41.730
And this one I guess we call the crotch.

00:41.740 --> 00:44.090
Let's do that.

00:44.740 --> 00:45.320
OK.

00:45.350 --> 00:47.770
So now that we know what those are.

00:48.050 --> 00:55.660
Let's duplicate this object right here by pressing shift D and then I'll press enter.

00:55.830 --> 01:03.840
And now let's just scale this out in the X. I'm just gonna hit X and X and drag the mouse out and let's

01:03.840 --> 01:08.000
extend it out B on this point here.

01:08.010 --> 01:12.680
Now this is just a temporary object we're going to delete it once we're done using this.

01:13.140 --> 01:20.480
But what I wanted was to be able to make this cut so it fits precisely with that center of cylinder.

01:20.730 --> 01:22.640
So let's select the hips now.

01:22.650 --> 01:30.510
Right here and let's go to our modifiers tab and we'll click on Add modifier and we want to select the

01:30.630 --> 01:32.830
boolean modifier.

01:32.850 --> 01:37.530
Now we need to make sure our operation is set to difference.

01:37.530 --> 01:44.520
And then over here under object we can select a little eyedropper right here and come over here and

01:44.520 --> 01:48.250
just click on that object that we want to do the cutting.

01:48.270 --> 01:55.220
Now we can come over here and just click apply and then I'll select that cutter object and just move

01:55.220 --> 01:56.360
it away.

01:56.420 --> 02:00.940
And now you can see we've got that same cut in the hips object.

02:01.040 --> 02:01.920
All right.

02:01.940 --> 02:08.480
And because I got that edge between the two edges of the cylinder if we selected and tab and edit mode

02:09.020 --> 02:13.580
you can see we don't have any real problems here we've got all quads.

02:13.580 --> 02:20.320
We've got four sided polygons all the way through here which is which is good.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.280
All right.

02:21.330 --> 02:24.840
So now we can just take this and delete it.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.220
I'll just hit delete.

02:26.260 --> 02:27.510
And there we go.

02:27.510 --> 02:31.140
Now let's take a look at the legs and to do the legs as well.

02:31.140 --> 02:33.240
I think we can just use this object.

02:33.450 --> 02:38.880
So what let's do is let's go back to that front view and what I'm going to do is just press shift D

02:39.180 --> 02:47.750
and X and then I'm a drag over and this will be our legs and then I want to scale this out so I'll press

02:47.810 --> 02:57.900
X and X and scale it out in the X just a bit and move it over just a little like this and then X and

02:57.900 --> 03:02.290
X again we get it about the right width like that.

03:02.320 --> 03:12.170
All right and we go So now what we need to do is extrude a few of the faces down here at the bottom

03:12.170 --> 03:16.040
of the cylinder down to create the leg.

03:16.040 --> 03:21.470
Let me go back to that other image that we had out here.

03:21.470 --> 03:22.310
This one here.

03:22.340 --> 03:28.970
Let's open this up and we can kind of see what's happening with the legs it's really kind of a cylinder

03:28.970 --> 03:29.900
here.

03:29.900 --> 03:33.590
It's being extended down from the bottom.

03:33.590 --> 03:41.630
So if we say select the cylinder tab into edit mode hit the three key to go to base mode.

03:41.630 --> 03:50.580
Now we can begin to select some of these bases to extrude down so maybe this one this one this one this

03:50.580 --> 03:56.260
one yeah maybe this one to something like this.

03:56.470 --> 04:03.990
We could try this however no let me bring I mean d select down let's try this here.

04:04.130 --> 04:05.470
Let's try this now.

04:05.950 --> 04:11.330
If we go to that front view we can see that it's got a bit of an overlap.

04:11.560 --> 04:18.340
It kind of extruded down and then extends out back toward the center of the character here.

04:18.340 --> 04:22.080
So we just need to keep that in mind as we're creating this.

04:22.240 --> 04:26.250
But the first thing we should do I think is just extrude straight down.

04:26.290 --> 04:32.270
So here in the side view I'm going to hit the E key and then I'm going to click and then I'm just going

04:32.270 --> 04:38.680
to grab in the z axis and drag straight down like this and then we go.

04:38.790 --> 04:44.160
Now we can also do is come back here and select this base right here.

04:44.160 --> 04:51.120
Let's go back to that side view with the three key and I just want to click and drag in the y until

04:51.120 --> 04:52.730
this is black.

04:52.830 --> 04:57.410
You see how this area right here just needs to be flat.

04:57.540 --> 05:09.440
Now I could take these bases here and flatten them in the y by pressing x and y and pushing in toward

05:09.500 --> 05:12.200
the center of the selection right there.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.000
Now let's go back and see how we did.

05:15.020 --> 05:15.220
Yeah.

05:15.230 --> 05:17.120
That's pretty flat there.

05:17.270 --> 05:18.320
Okay.

05:18.320 --> 05:24.680
That worked out pretty good so let's now go down here and select these and we can do the same thing.

05:24.680 --> 05:32.390
So let's go select these go back to that side view with three key and now instead of in the y axis let's

05:32.390 --> 05:38.780
do it in the z axis let's press s and z and just move the mouse straight down toward the center of that

05:38.900 --> 05:43.170
selection and that just kind of flattens them all up like that.

05:43.300 --> 05:43.640
All right.

05:43.670 --> 05:47.960
Now we'll just grab it in the z axis and drag it down to the grid right there.

05:48.760 --> 05:52.030
Now before we do anything else let's go over and take a look at this.

05:52.030 --> 05:54.810
Remember we have to deal with this too.

05:54.850 --> 06:00.960
So what we should probably do is select these faces here and extrude them out.

06:00.970 --> 06:05.760
But if we do we'll be right flush against that cylinder and I don't think we want that.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.990
We want just a little bit of room there.

06:09.010 --> 06:13.540
I mean go to the wireframe now you can see there's just a little bit of room there.

06:13.540 --> 06:21.410
So we really need to add an edge before we extrude toward the center of the character to do that.

06:21.410 --> 06:28.490
Let me go back to this view and on press Z and solid so you can see what we're doing here and what I'm

06:28.490 --> 06:35.150
going to do is press control are and that turns on the loop cut tool and here it is if I then click

06:35.780 --> 06:43.670
one time I can then drag this up and down here and if I move toward one edge you can see it kind of

06:43.700 --> 06:49.400
conforms to that edge and if I move it toward the other edge it kind of conforms to that edge but it

06:49.400 --> 06:51.410
isn't quite perfect.

06:51.410 --> 06:59.180
What we can do is now hit the E key and it will change between conforming to one edge you can see now

06:59.360 --> 07:06.830
no matter where I move it it stays conformed to this edge on the top or I can hit the f key now and

07:06.830 --> 07:07.840
flip it.

07:07.880 --> 07:15.370
Now you can see the edge is staying conformed to the bottom edge no matter where I put it.

07:15.440 --> 07:21.320
So I'm going to hit the f key and conform it to this edge up here and then I'm going to click right

07:21.320 --> 07:30.810
about here to drop the edge right there so once again that's just control are for the loop cut tool

07:31.080 --> 07:37.920
you click and then you can hit the E key and flip between the two edges with the FCC.

07:37.950 --> 07:38.220
All right.

07:38.220 --> 07:45.240
So now that I've got this I'm going to go to face mode with the three key select these bases right in

07:45.240 --> 07:54.000
here and then let's go back to that front view and let's hit e and pull out just a little bit like this

07:55.020 --> 07:56.610
and we go.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.330
All right let's take a look at what we've done here.

08:00.080 --> 08:04.400
Yeah I think that's actually pretty good yeah.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.220
That kind of conforms to that pretty well all right.

08:08.250 --> 08:09.810
So we've done that.

08:09.810 --> 08:12.230
The next thing we need to do is probably the feet.

08:12.810 --> 08:16.820
So let's select the leg and tab back into edit mode.

08:16.830 --> 08:26.370
Let's once again press control ah and go into the loop cut tool will click will press E then we'll press

08:26.490 --> 08:31.230
F and flip it so it conforms to that bottom edge.

08:32.560 --> 08:35.140
And we'll get it right about here.

08:35.150 --> 08:44.060
Let's say let's try that if the three key select these two bases out front and then let's extrude them

08:44.060 --> 08:50.920
out for the feet so I'll hit e and pull them straight out like that.

08:51.020 --> 08:55.370
That's pretty good in terms of the length of the foot there I think.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.250
But I didn't do very well with the height of the foot.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.120
Now did I.

08:59.270 --> 09:03.340
Looks like this is thicker than this.

09:03.350 --> 09:05.720
So what can we do for that.

09:05.720 --> 09:12.710
I think we could switch to edge mode with the two key alt click this edge right here so it goes all

09:12.710 --> 09:21.460
the way around like that then what we should do is select these edges out here so I'll press Alt shift

09:21.700 --> 09:27.600
click that edge and let's just go ahead and select these edges as well.

09:27.630 --> 09:30.060
Oh and this one right in here.

09:30.060 --> 09:31.380
Here we go.

09:31.380 --> 09:36.870
Now we should be able just to click and drag and make these a little bit taller.

09:36.870 --> 09:43.810
Let's see maybe something like this let's give this a try.

09:44.090 --> 09:50.240
I may need to bring that up even more now actually let's select it and instead of just selecting those

09:50.240 --> 09:57.580
edges again what I'm gonna do is go to the three key to the side view go to wireframe I'm to tab into

09:57.590 --> 10:03.290
edit mode and this time I'm going to press the one key to go to vertex mode.

10:03.380 --> 10:09.290
Now if I come up here to the select blocks I can click right here and click and drag.

10:09.290 --> 10:18.290
Now I've got all those points selected and I can now move them up and down just like I did before and

10:18.320 --> 10:21.760
this time I want to bring it up quite a bit like that.

10:21.770 --> 10:23.120
There we go.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.330
All right.

10:24.410 --> 10:29.580
So now we have a leg done and we've cut into the hip piece there.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.900
I think in the next video what we should do is begin working on the arms.
