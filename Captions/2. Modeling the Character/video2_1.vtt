WEBVTT

00:00.840 --> 00:06.570
Before I start modeling I'd like to bring in a few reference images just so I'd get a better understanding

00:06.570 --> 00:08.280
of what I'm working on.

00:08.280 --> 00:14.890
Actually before I even do that let me hit the a key and delete everything here.

00:14.920 --> 00:15.640
There we go.

00:15.640 --> 00:25.000
And then I'll press shift a And let's bring in an image empty blender 2.8 has some nice reference image

00:25.030 --> 00:29.410
features here so let's just go ahead and bring in a reference image here.

00:29.530 --> 00:37.330
And when we do let me show you what happens if I go to my reference images folder here and I'm gonna

00:37.330 --> 00:41.440
click this icon right here and this is a good one to bring in.

00:41.440 --> 00:47.470
I'm just gonna bring in this view right here by click load reference image you can see what happens

00:47.470 --> 00:51.330
it comes in at the angle of the viewport.

00:51.430 --> 00:56.470
So what we really need to do is choose what view we want to see this in and then bring it in.

00:56.470 --> 01:03.360
So press control Z let's hit the one key and now I'm here in the front or the graphic view.

01:03.460 --> 01:08.740
So now if I press shift a and bring in that reference image object.

01:08.740 --> 01:10.240
Here we go.

01:10.270 --> 01:13.170
Now he's in the proper viewport.

01:13.270 --> 01:19.890
I would like to bring it back in the y axis just a bit so I'll hit the end key to bring up the sidebar

01:19.900 --> 01:28.180
here and in the location and Y maybe I'll just type in five just to bring it back off of that axis off

01:28.180 --> 01:36.040
of the center of the grid just a bit and then if I hit the one key and come over here to the object

01:36.100 --> 01:38.350
data panel right here.

01:38.800 --> 01:45.730
Now I can move it in the x and y so I can get him more aligned in the center and actually standing on

01:45.730 --> 01:46.300
the grid.

01:46.300 --> 01:53.170
So if I bring him up in the y you can see I can just click and drag in that field there and drag him

01:53.170 --> 01:58.140
up so his feet are are standing on the x axis.

01:58.150 --> 02:01.590
Let me bring that up just a little bit more right about right about there.

02:01.590 --> 02:02.570
Let's say.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.830
But also you can see he's off center a bit.

02:05.830 --> 02:12.440
So if I click and drag on the x axis I can bring him back into the center so his.

02:12.520 --> 02:16.470
So the center of the jacket is aligned there.

02:16.540 --> 02:19.330
It's a photograph taken with perspective of course.

02:19.330 --> 02:21.270
So it's gonna be a little bit off.

02:21.280 --> 02:28.330
You can see how his leg is turned here a bit and this was higher than the other one and that's fine.

02:28.330 --> 02:31.360
We're just going to use this as a general reference.

02:31.360 --> 02:36.260
We're not going to get it exact to engineering specifications or anything.

02:36.280 --> 02:43.240
Also I want to click and drag this transparency and bring this down quite a bit about like this.

02:43.240 --> 02:46.970
I'll just actually click on it and type in point by.

02:47.020 --> 02:48.490
There we go.

02:48.580 --> 02:56.320
Now in addition we can also set it up so we can see it or not in the perspective view and I kind of

02:56.320 --> 02:59.810
like to not see it actually so I'm going to turn that off.

02:59.830 --> 03:06.550
So as we model the only time we're going to see it is when we're in that front or the graphic view.

03:06.580 --> 03:06.940
All right.

03:06.940 --> 03:09.540
So I think that works out pretty well.

03:09.580 --> 03:12.880
You can certainly set these however you want.

03:12.880 --> 03:13.190
All right.

03:13.210 --> 03:15.720
So let's go ahead and begin.

03:15.940 --> 03:19.180
Back in the front view let's go ahead and begin with the head.

03:19.210 --> 03:22.500
Let's go ahead and bring in a cylinder.

03:22.630 --> 03:23.800
I'll press shift a.

03:23.830 --> 03:32.560
And go to mesh and cylinder and I'll come over here and just open up this window right here and currently

03:32.560 --> 03:38.910
it's got 32 sides and I don't think we need that many since I'm planning on this to be a game character

03:38.920 --> 03:41.050
I'm going to try and keep it fairly low poly.

03:41.200 --> 03:51.070
So let's type in 16 here and also for the cat fill instead of just one big face on the top and the bottom.

03:51.120 --> 03:57.140
I want to change this to Triangle fan which will split it up into triangles kind of like a PI.

03:57.280 --> 03:57.610
All right.

03:57.640 --> 04:04.330
So now that we have that let's go ahead and hit Z and go to wireframe and then I'll come over here and

04:04.330 --> 04:11.450
click on the move tool here and we can then click and drag this up and then we're gonna need to scale

04:11.450 --> 04:15.650
that down so I'll hit the S Key and scale that down.

04:15.760 --> 04:16.780
All right let's zoom in.

04:16.780 --> 04:23.590
I can hit the period key to zoom in and then get the S Key again and yeah you can see how the head isn't

04:23.590 --> 04:29.440
quite aligned with the center of the grid here it's kind of turned and that's OK we're going to just

04:29.440 --> 04:30.540
do the best we can here.

04:30.550 --> 04:36.780
I'm going to have it kind of overlap here and kind of overlap here kind of in the same amount.

04:36.790 --> 04:42.420
I'm gonna hit the S and the Z key and scale and the Z right.

04:42.420 --> 04:46.680
Here we go about like that yeah.

04:46.720 --> 04:53.640
That's about the right size I think now what I need to do is select these edges and give them a bit

04:53.640 --> 04:54.660
of a bevel.

04:54.660 --> 04:57.340
This curve right here is a bevel.

04:57.360 --> 05:04.230
So if I hit the Z key again and go to solid view let's go ahead and tab into edit mode I'll just hit

05:04.230 --> 05:11.280
the tab key and we'll then go into edit mode and we can see all the edges and the polygons and the points

05:11.280 --> 05:12.810
of that object.

05:12.810 --> 05:15.200
I'll press Alt A to D select everything.

05:15.210 --> 05:21.090
And now I want to select the edges down here on the bottom first so you can see over here we've got

05:21.210 --> 05:26.670
vertex select edge select and face select here in vertex select.

05:26.670 --> 05:31.210
I can choose one of these and select that point in Edge mode.

05:31.220 --> 05:36.730
I can select edges and in face mode I can select different faces.

05:36.960 --> 05:42.900
And in addition you can just press the one two or three keys for these three selection mode.

05:42.900 --> 05:47.330
So 1 4 vertices 2 4 edges and 3 4 faces.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.500
So I'll press the two key.

05:49.650 --> 05:56.280
I'll press Alt A to D select and then to select this whole ring of edges all the way around.

05:56.280 --> 06:01.020
I'll press Alt and click here and that will select that entire edge.

06:01.020 --> 06:03.420
Now let's go back to that front view.

06:03.480 --> 06:09.020
I'll go to wireframe and let's Bevel this so we get that curve right there.

06:09.090 --> 06:15.210
We're going to Bevel the edge so to go up to the edges menu and right here is the bevel.

06:15.210 --> 06:17.730
Now we can also press control B so I'll just do that.

06:17.730 --> 06:24.960
I'll press control B and I'll drag the mouse until we get about maybe right here.

06:25.290 --> 06:29.570
So you can see how that curve goes basically from here to here.

06:29.580 --> 06:36.630
So now we can add new segments I'll just click here and we'll add let's add four segments right there.

06:36.630 --> 06:39.590
So that gives us that General curve.

06:39.630 --> 06:40.620
All right.

06:40.620 --> 06:41.460
Now let's do that.

06:41.460 --> 06:47.910
On the top and do these at the same time because I think I want the bevel to be slightly different.

06:48.150 --> 06:55.800
So I'll go back to that front view and here I'll just press control B and drag the mouse and it'll hold

06:55.800 --> 06:59.320
those general settings that we had before.

06:59.370 --> 07:01.400
I'll just bring it down to about right here I think.

07:01.410 --> 07:04.890
Let's see I'll hit the Z key and go to wireframe.

07:04.890 --> 07:07.440
Is that about right.

07:07.450 --> 07:14.000
Well maybe I'll take the width down just a little bit with maybe don't need it quite that deep.

07:14.130 --> 07:15.220
There we go.

07:15.220 --> 07:18.280
I just wanted to get that up into the hair.

07:18.280 --> 07:18.490
All right.

07:18.490 --> 07:22.990
Now we can tumble around go to Z and solid mode.

07:22.990 --> 07:25.980
And there we have the beginnings of our head.

07:25.990 --> 07:30.160
We also need to extrude pieces from the top and the bottom here.

07:30.160 --> 07:38.890
Let's go back to base mode with the three key and instead of just clicking and shift clicking all of

07:38.890 --> 07:45.130
these what we can do is hit the C key for the circle select tool and just click and drag and kind of

07:45.130 --> 07:47.020
paint that selection.

07:47.020 --> 07:51.100
Then we hit the right mouse button to get out of that tool.

07:51.100 --> 07:56.430
Now I can go back to that front view and it looks like that's pretty good.

07:56.430 --> 08:02.590
The with there looks pretty good I'll just hit the E key and drag the mouse down to about right here

08:03.740 --> 08:05.260
and then we go.

08:05.480 --> 08:13.630
Now this top part let's deselect everything with all a press that see key again and select all of those.

08:13.640 --> 08:21.530
Now we need to extrude and scale that in a bit because usually the top nub on a lego character's head

08:21.530 --> 08:24.080
is usually smaller than the one around the neck.

08:24.080 --> 08:33.410
So what let's do is listed E and then we'll hit the esky and we'll scale and just move the mouse a bit.

08:33.410 --> 08:40.500
We get about right there and then I'll just hit the E key and drag up just a little bit like that.

08:40.510 --> 08:41.320
There we go.

08:41.320 --> 08:41.680
All right.

08:41.680 --> 08:44.380
So now we have the head of the character.

08:44.440 --> 08:52.030
Well we can also do is smooth it a bit so we don't have this kind of blocking this faceted look to it

08:52.060 --> 08:54.470
where we can see the polygon so clearly.

08:55.150 --> 09:00.280
Well let's do is right click and let's go to shade smooth right here.

09:00.280 --> 09:06.450
Now that smooth it up quite a bit but we're getting some strange artifacts here up on the top.

09:06.490 --> 09:14.470
So let's come over here to the object data panel again and to the normals section and I'll scroll that

09:14.470 --> 09:19.330
down and I'll turn on auto smooth and when we do that you can see that kind of cleaned it up quite a

09:19.330 --> 09:20.230
bit.

09:20.230 --> 09:26.200
But what we can do is click and drag in this angle field and if I drag it all the way down that's the

09:26.200 --> 09:28.720
way it was at zero there.

09:28.720 --> 09:32.800
Now if I drag it up we can begin to clean some of this up.

09:32.810 --> 09:39.540
If I drag it too far you can see we get those kinds of artifacts again.

09:39.540 --> 09:43.080
Let's drag it down below 90 percent and see what we get here

09:45.750 --> 09:46.590
that's pretty good.

09:46.590 --> 09:50.000
I'm an eighty nine and we've cleaned up that edge.

09:50.010 --> 09:52.940
That's kind of a hard edge now which is what I wanted.

09:52.950 --> 09:55.940
But this one down here is still kind of soft.

09:55.950 --> 10:01.080
So let's click and drag this until we get that.

10:01.170 --> 10:01.950
There we go.

10:01.980 --> 10:05.770
So we just needed it below 80 I guess.

10:05.770 --> 10:06.920
Here we go.

10:06.930 --> 10:10.010
So that kind of smooths that up quite a bit.

10:10.020 --> 10:10.680
All right.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.370
So in the next video let's continue on with the torso.
