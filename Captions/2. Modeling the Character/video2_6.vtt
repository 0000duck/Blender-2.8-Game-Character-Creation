00:00.660 --> 00:06.750
To create the risks coming out of the hand we're going to need to have a round object coming out of

00:07.110 --> 00:10.090
what will essentially be square polygons.

00:10.110 --> 00:13.240
So we need to think about how we're gonna do that.

00:13.260 --> 00:20.280
I think probably the best way to do that will be to attach a cylinder to a hole in the top here that

00:20.280 --> 00:22.370
has the same number of sides.

00:22.440 --> 00:29.940
So let's go ahead and press control ah and scroll the mouse wheel and let's add three cuts on the hand

00:29.940 --> 00:33.090
here or click and then click again and there we go.

00:33.090 --> 00:43.190
So now if we select four faces here at the top what that will be is eight sides.

00:43.190 --> 00:48.040
So two or six eight eight edges all the way around.

00:48.140 --> 00:53.210
So let's delete this with X and delete bases.

00:53.210 --> 01:00.500
And now this hole here has the same number of sides as say an eight sided cylinder.

01:00.500 --> 01:01.670
So that's what we need to do.

01:01.670 --> 01:06.720
We need to bring in an eight sided cylinder and attach it to this hole.

01:06.770 --> 01:14.480
So let me grab these points here and I'm just going to scale them out in the y s y just scale them out

01:14.480 --> 01:16.340
a bit like this.

01:16.340 --> 01:16.730
All right.

01:16.730 --> 01:24.200
So now let's all click an edge here and select that whole edge loop around the hole there.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.960
And let's move the cursor to that.

01:25.970 --> 01:33.560
So I'll press shift s and cursor to selected and that's where the new object will be created.

01:33.560 --> 01:41.900
So if we stay in edit mode now the new object that we create will also be an edit mode and we'll be

01:41.900 --> 01:47.130
a part of this object will be just another piece of this same object.

01:47.180 --> 01:48.290
So let's try that.

01:48.290 --> 01:50.840
We've been creating objects in object mode.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.530
Let's try it in edit mode here now.

01:52.730 --> 02:00.980
So let's press shift a and I'll create a cylinder and here it is kind of big.

02:00.980 --> 02:05.660
It's got 16 sides we want eight right.

02:05.670 --> 02:13.790
And in addition we could reduce the radius here by clicking and dragging and we could also reduce the

02:13.790 --> 02:21.300
height or the depth right here we can just kind of bring that in something like this.

02:21.330 --> 02:25.580
Now we can of course just hit the esky and scale it in as well.

02:25.740 --> 02:29.750
So let's do that let's hit s and scale that in a bit.

02:29.820 --> 02:30.360
That's it.

02:30.400 --> 02:37.060
S and z and scale it in a bit here and then just bring it up and kind of line it up with that right

02:37.060 --> 02:38.010
there.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.080
All right.

02:39.160 --> 02:48.070
So now what we can do is in Edge mode we can all click this edge and shift all click that edge.

02:48.070 --> 02:52.870
And now with these two edges selected we could bridge those edge loops.

02:52.870 --> 02:55.720
I think actually let me bring this up a little bit higher.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.530
I'm going to go to the side view and I think I need to bring it up.

02:58.540 --> 03:02.920
So it is in alignment with this top edge here.

03:02.980 --> 03:09.730
So I'm just going to hover over this cylinder and press the L key and that will select all the linked

03:09.730 --> 03:12.090
components of that edge.

03:12.100 --> 03:18.090
Now I can just click and drag up and let's kind of get it in line with that top edge there.

03:18.190 --> 03:18.590
OK.

03:18.640 --> 03:24.570
So now by all click this edge and shift all click this edge.

03:24.610 --> 03:26.430
Now let's bridge them together.

03:26.430 --> 03:26.890
I'll press.

03:26.880 --> 03:32.310
Control e and let's use bridge edge loops in the edges.

03:32.340 --> 03:34.420
Menu click that.

03:34.510 --> 03:35.470
And there we go.

03:35.470 --> 03:38.410
OK so now how do we do.

03:38.410 --> 03:44.800
Well not too bad but now we have a problem where the polygon ends up here are very visible and faceted

03:45.190 --> 03:46.800
whereas these are more smooth.

03:46.810 --> 03:55.830
So we can take this down here and slide this and drag these all we want but it isn't changing those.

03:55.930 --> 04:04.570
What we have to do is re apply that smooth shade so let's right click and choose shade flat and then

04:04.570 --> 04:08.410
will right click again and choose shade smooth.

04:08.410 --> 04:14.530
Now that's helped quite a bit there and I can drag this up and let's see if we can get it to a point

04:14.530 --> 04:17.950
where it looks pretty good for us here.

04:18.070 --> 04:19.300
Let's see how that looks.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.800
I mean tumble around.

04:21.970 --> 04:27.960
That's not too bad actually maybe right about there.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.170
Let's give that a try.

04:29.920 --> 04:36.400
So now to put it into the arm let's tab back into edit mode and select this edge and let's move the

04:36.400 --> 04:47.050
cursor shift s and cursor to selected right here now what we can do is tab back and object mode and

04:47.050 --> 04:52.030
move this origin to the 3d cursor so now it's right click set.

04:52.030 --> 04:55.310
Origin origin to 3d cursor.

04:55.540 --> 05:00.670
Now that Origin is right there and we can move and rotate this.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.710
At that point all right.

05:02.740 --> 05:04.420
So let's bring everything back.

05:04.420 --> 05:09.760
I'll come up here to the characters scene collection and enable it with the icon here.

05:10.800 --> 05:19.330
Now let's try and move this into place so I'll move it forward with the G key it are rotated up some

05:20.120 --> 05:21.880
right and put it right in here.

05:22.690 --> 05:28.120
Then let's come up here and turn it like this

05:31.980 --> 05:32.250
now.

05:32.250 --> 05:38.830
Also we can change our axes here our transform axes from global to local.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.540
So if we do that.

05:40.560 --> 05:46.370
Watch what happens to our transformation gizmo here I'll change it to local.

05:46.380 --> 05:49.550
And you can see now it's in line with the object itself.

05:50.010 --> 05:55.540
So we can move the object in or out in line with its angle here.

05:55.620 --> 05:58.990
So maybe I'll bring it in like that.

05:59.940 --> 06:01.590
Maybe shrink it just a bit.

06:01.590 --> 06:06.440
It's kind of hard to tell what we need to do with that.

06:06.470 --> 06:08.020
But I think that's looking pretty good.

06:08.020 --> 06:13.650
I'm gonna press shift C and bring that cursor back to the center of the grid.

06:13.650 --> 06:21.000
What we need to do now is to move the arm and the hand and the leg over to the other side to mirror

06:21.000 --> 06:23.620
them over to the other side.

06:23.640 --> 06:30.810
But first what let's do is take this hand and then shift select this arm and let's join these two objects

06:30.900 --> 06:31.740
together.

06:31.740 --> 06:39.420
So they're all one piece to do that I'll press control Jay and that'll join those and then we want to

06:39.420 --> 06:41.690
mirror this over to the other side.

06:41.730 --> 06:44.590
However take a look at what happened here.

06:44.670 --> 06:52.100
We zoom in here you can see the wrist went back to being that blocky shading.

06:52.170 --> 06:59.610
So we kind of need to come down here again now that we've combined these two and re adjust the angle

07:00.120 --> 07:04.500
maybe something like this and we go that smooth it up a bit.

07:04.650 --> 07:05.100
Yeah.

07:05.130 --> 07:13.950
And in addition maybe we need a bevel on the sleeve here look how curved that edge is maybe we need

07:14.010 --> 07:14.790
a bevel there.

07:14.790 --> 07:20.990
Let's tab into edit mode and select the two key for Edge mode and alt click.

07:21.000 --> 07:29.930
This all edge loop right there and before we do that let's take a look at our rotation and scale and

07:30.440 --> 07:35.590
our values are kind of non uniform especially in the rotation here.

07:35.970 --> 07:43.900
Let's come over and press control a and click rotation and scale and that resets all of those there.

07:43.910 --> 07:52.180
Now if we tap into edit mode and press control B we can add a little Bevel to that there.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.620
Yeah that's that's kind of nice.

07:54.720 --> 07:55.920
Let's do that.

07:56.880 --> 07:57.180
All right.

07:57.210 --> 08:06.630
So now we could mirror this over before I do though I see that this is a little bit out of alignment

08:06.630 --> 08:14.250
I'm going to move it over just a bit like this and we go now Let's mirror this over to do that I need

08:14.250 --> 08:20.880
to move this origin into the center of the grid because the object is going to mirror around wherever

08:20.880 --> 08:21.840
that origin is.

08:21.840 --> 08:30.690
So let me show you what I mean if I go over to the modifiers panel and go add a modifier mirror look

08:30.690 --> 08:33.300
at where it's measuring from right there.

08:33.420 --> 08:36.180
We need to move that origin into the center of the grid.

08:36.180 --> 08:43.200
So it'll mirror over to the other side to do that let's just right click choose set Origin and Origin

08:43.200 --> 08:45.540
to 3d cursor and there it is.

08:45.540 --> 08:50.510
Now it pops over to the other side because the origin is in the center.

08:50.520 --> 08:54.640
Let's do the same thing for the leg here.

08:54.670 --> 09:02.320
I'm going to apply the rotation in scale again with control a right here and then I'm going to move

09:02.320 --> 09:08.770
that origin right click to the 3d cursor right there.

09:08.770 --> 09:16.660
And now let's add a mirror modifier here add modifier mirror and you can see it's mirroring in the x

09:16.660 --> 09:17.660
axis.

09:17.660 --> 09:19.080
And there we go.

09:19.090 --> 09:24.330
So there's our character at least the beginnings of it right where we're getting there.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.760
I think we could go ahead and smooth the legs here.

09:27.760 --> 09:37.390
Let's do that shade smooth and then come over here to Object data turn on auto smooth and see what we

09:37.390 --> 09:39.580
can get with this.

09:39.740 --> 09:41.360
That looks pretty good there.

09:41.510 --> 09:49.220
Also with this cylinder all it's applied shade smooth here turn on auto smooth.

09:50.060 --> 09:55.810
And same thing that looks pretty good like that well we've got the basic character setup.

09:55.810 --> 10:01.210
Now what let's do in the next video is work on the hair.

10:01.210 --> 10:08.620
We'll need to bring in some geometry and begin molding the hair to the head.
