WEBVTT

00:00.790 --> 00:05.470
Now let's work on just getting the hair a little bit more shaped the way we'd like it.

00:05.470 --> 00:12.280
I think what I'll do is tab and edit mode and I'll change to the proportional editing tool here.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.410
I will enable it.

00:13.450 --> 00:19.150
And then what we can do is just begin selecting a point here and hitting G.

00:19.150 --> 00:25.510
And then we can scroll the mouse wheel again and just begin moving in or out depending on what you need.

00:25.540 --> 00:33.760
I think I'd like this area to maybe come up a little more maybe this could come up and I'm just going

00:33.760 --> 00:38.680
to try and get it to look a little bit more like I have in my head.

00:38.910 --> 00:44.470
That's all I think I'd maybe like to take this and move it up just a bit.

00:45.180 --> 00:54.020
Like this and I feel like we need these to come up a little bit too so maybe I'll go to the side view

00:54.020 --> 01:02.440
here and just hit G and move this up I'll hit ult Z again so I can see through this and maybe I'll select

01:03.130 --> 01:06.440
one over here on the other side and do that same thing.

01:06.490 --> 01:13.420
So we kind of bring them up in the same way it looks to me like we may need to bring this area out some

01:13.510 --> 01:16.020
back here I'll hit G.

01:16.030 --> 01:23.240
And let's just move this out a bit like that we could maybe grab this and move this out so you can see

01:23.330 --> 01:31.040
all I'm doing is just selecting a point using the proportional editing tool just to get it a little

01:31.040 --> 01:36.190
bit more in line with what I was imagining.

01:36.240 --> 01:39.000
I mean tumble around here and see how we're doing

01:41.720 --> 01:48.860
yeah I think I may want to bring those sideburns down just a little bit more you can see how it's pretty

01:48.860 --> 01:54.650
far down here and there's kind of a more of a straight up and down angle there and I think I kind of

01:54.650 --> 01:55.330
like that.

01:55.340 --> 01:59.180
So I'm going to bring this down just a bit.

01:59.180 --> 02:07.190
Let me press control three to go to the left or the graphic and I'll just bring this down and then scroll

02:07.280 --> 02:08.810
in a bit.

02:08.810 --> 02:21.360
Maybe grab this one bring this up maybe here and bring this up a bit Yeah I think we're getting there

02:21.360 --> 02:27.260
and let me go to the side view here and press all dizzy and see what I can see over on that side.

02:27.290 --> 02:27.490
Yeah.

02:27.510 --> 02:34.080
So I just feel like I need to bring this down a bit maybe I'll grab this and bring this up again.

02:34.080 --> 02:34.990
There we go.

02:36.410 --> 02:37.180
All right.

02:37.340 --> 02:40.170
Let's see how we're doing.

02:40.360 --> 02:40.960
I see.

02:40.990 --> 02:50.240
There's an edge here and an edge here that I think maybe I'll just scale out in the X S and X Oh let

02:50.240 --> 02:56.690
me turn off the proportional editing tool with the okey and then S and X again and pull those out just

02:56.690 --> 02:57.900
a bit.

02:57.980 --> 03:02.850
Let's see if that helps at all maybe a little yeah.

03:02.890 --> 03:03.370
OK.

03:03.380 --> 03:04.850
I think that's pretty good.

03:05.570 --> 03:11.180
I'm just tumbling around trying to see if there's anything I want to try and fix at this point in the

03:11.180 --> 03:21.020
game maybe I'll bring it up just a little bit over here me I feel like maybe in the front here I'm gonna

03:21.040 --> 03:29.100
hit oh to turn on the proportional editing tool again hit G bring this out and then scroll out like

03:29.100 --> 03:30.170
that.

03:30.220 --> 03:31.480
There we go.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.990
And maybe back here now that I take a look at it.

03:34.740 --> 03:43.830
So just go through and use the proportional editing tool to try and mold it to shape it the way you

03:43.830 --> 03:44.240
want.

03:45.450 --> 03:47.560
Maybe I'll bring this in just a little bit.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.290
Like uh.

03:49.860 --> 03:57.770
And I'm just trying to look at it from all points of view here from all angles Yeah.

03:57.780 --> 03:59.520
I think that's pretty good.

04:00.510 --> 04:01.380
All right.

04:01.380 --> 04:08.070
So now what I want to do is delete some of the bases on the inside because we just don't need all of

04:08.070 --> 04:10.350
the geometry that's on the inside.

04:10.350 --> 04:16.860
And once I do that then I'm going to begin pulling some points into mold it to the head just a little

04:16.860 --> 04:18.930
bit better along here.

04:18.930 --> 04:27.060
So first of all let's select that hair and let's hit the division key on the number pad and it doesn't

04:27.060 --> 04:30.150
look like it's working real well let me try that again.

04:30.150 --> 04:31.080
There we go.

04:31.110 --> 04:33.190
That's the way it's supposed to work.

04:33.240 --> 04:40.200
Let's tab and edit mode and I'll hit the three key and go to face mode and what I'd like to do is just

04:40.680 --> 04:48.390
select some of these bases in here and then I'm going to press control plus to expand the selection

04:48.450 --> 04:59.830
out like this until I get about what I want here I think I want to go out to here let some alt shift

04:59.830 --> 05:08.380
click right between these two faces and that'll D select that row and I'll do the same thing here.

05:08.400 --> 05:17.000
Perhaps I should d select these and then I'm going to come back and press shift and select these along

05:17.010 --> 05:20.320
here.

05:20.380 --> 05:27.880
I feel like I could d select this and this and I feel like these are a little bit close to the edge

05:27.880 --> 05:30.160
as well so maybe I'll D select those.

05:30.160 --> 05:38.060
I'm just trying to leave a good rim a good collection of edges along here yeah.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.300
I think this is pretty good.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.430
Let's go ahead and delete these.

05:41.460 --> 05:46.410
So now with all of these selected I'll just hit X and delete faces and there we go.

05:46.410 --> 05:54.180
So now we've got the inside of the hair all deleted out of there so we won't have extra polygons on

05:54.180 --> 05:56.830
our character if we aren't going to see something.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.680
We should probably delete it.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.830
So I mean tab back into object mode.

06:01.940 --> 06:05.290
Get the division key to bring everything else back.

06:05.310 --> 06:12.360
And now it's come in here and begin adjusting some of these points so they mold to the head just a little

06:12.360 --> 06:13.260
bit better.

06:13.320 --> 06:20.300
So I go to vertex select mode and let's just kind of grab some of these and begin pulling them in.

06:20.370 --> 06:23.800
But let's turn off that proportional editing tool.

06:23.880 --> 06:29.100
Press the okey again and let's just bring these back in here like this.

06:29.130 --> 06:32.460
Now we may also need to bring them up some too but that's OK.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.940
We can do that.

06:33.970 --> 06:34.410
Oh here we go.

06:34.410 --> 06:44.590
I'm just going to bring them in like this and begin connecting them or closing off this gap we have

06:44.590 --> 06:46.810
between the head and the hair.

06:46.810 --> 06:54.110
We don't want to be able to see up into the head between the hair and the head here right up move this

06:54.110 --> 07:04.080
in and this and I'll just continue on along here until we get them all closed up.

07:04.190 --> 07:09.740
All right now as I mentioned I'm going to need to come in here and select some of these and pull them

07:09.740 --> 07:11.120
up.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.780
You don't need them this low on the head here

07:16.940 --> 07:17.170
all right.

07:17.180 --> 07:20.180
Let's see how that looks.

07:20.180 --> 07:22.610
Yep we've got that closed off there.

07:23.730 --> 07:29.520
Let's take a look around the back and see if there's any areas that need to be closed off back there.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.710
No I think that's pretty good.

07:31.740 --> 07:40.570
OK so we now have our whole character modeled and ready to go in the next part of the course.

07:40.590 --> 07:43.460
What we're going to be doing is going in and you V.

07:43.470 --> 07:46.830
Mapping each of the parts of the character.

07:46.980 --> 07:54.420
And then once we have them all you ve mapped will combine everything and pack them all in to a single

07:54.780 --> 07:55.870
UV map.

07:56.130 --> 07:57.510
So that's coming up next.
