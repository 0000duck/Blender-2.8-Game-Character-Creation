00:00.700 --> 00:05.290
To create the hair I think I'll bring in a new reference image over here.

00:05.290 --> 00:08.560
Let's take a look at this one again.

00:08.560 --> 00:13.870
And I think the hair we can see a little bit of the hair on the side of the head.

00:13.990 --> 00:16.660
And this isn't going to be exactly like this.

00:16.660 --> 00:20.870
I don't want to do it exactly but that'll just give me a general idea.

00:20.920 --> 00:27.040
Now even though it is kind of a rounded object I'm going to begin the hair with a cube.

00:27.040 --> 00:35.170
So let's just press shift a And let's bring in a cube right here and then I'll go to that front view

00:35.200 --> 00:41.380
and wire frame and let's bring it up and kind of put it in place right up here I'm going to scale it

00:41.380 --> 00:43.700
down with the esky and get it.

00:43.780 --> 00:49.370
I don't know generally the right size about like this maybe.

00:49.510 --> 00:55.870
And then what let's do is add a subdivision surface modifier to begin to kind of curve it.

00:55.900 --> 01:02.650
So let's come over here to the modifiers panel right here and let's add a subdivision surface modifier

01:03.040 --> 01:08.530
and this will add resolution to the cube which will begin to curve the corners.

01:08.650 --> 01:12.480
So we'll click here and you can see what's beginning to happen there.

01:12.490 --> 01:18.970
Let's go ahead and scale this back out now so we can make it about the size of the character's hair

01:18.970 --> 01:20.170
there.

01:20.180 --> 01:24.470
Now let's go to the salad view and this is what we have so far.

01:24.610 --> 01:29.580
So let's maybe increase the viewer just a bit right here and there we go.

01:29.580 --> 01:36.750
So now we're beginning to get the amount of geometry we need to delete and mold this for the hair.

01:36.760 --> 01:43.510
Let me go back to the front view again and how we doing on the size here.

01:43.510 --> 01:44.620
Not too bad.

01:44.620 --> 01:52.690
We could maybe put it right about here let's say now if we take a look at this in edit mode we can see

01:52.690 --> 02:00.340
that we still have just the original cube everything that's been subdivided in here is just a preview.

02:00.340 --> 02:04.220
We need to apply this to be able to work with this geometry.

02:04.270 --> 02:09.930
So I'll go ahead and tab into object mode again and then come over and hit apply.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.790
Now if we tap back into edit mode you can see the geometry has been baked into the cube.

02:15.820 --> 02:16.060
All right.

02:16.060 --> 02:19.150
So now we need to begin removing some of these bases.

02:19.150 --> 02:25.660
Let's go to the side view and let's go to wireframe and then let's hit the three key to go to face mode.

02:25.660 --> 02:28.690
So what should we get rid of here.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.130
Let me press Alt A D select.

02:31.360 --> 02:40.600
I've changed my selection tool from the select box to select lasso so that we can just kind of click

02:40.600 --> 02:45.610
and drag a lasso around faces like this to delete them.

02:45.610 --> 02:47.860
So I think we should probably delete these.

02:47.860 --> 02:49.700
Let's go ahead and delete those.

02:49.750 --> 02:53.800
We probably should delete these in here.

02:53.860 --> 03:07.340
Let me do that again right in here like that and we could probably delete these right here as well x

03:08.270 --> 03:09.830
and faces.

03:09.890 --> 03:10.120
All right.

03:10.130 --> 03:11.650
Let's see how that works.

03:11.660 --> 03:16.790
Let's go back to the front view and let's go to solid.

03:16.820 --> 03:19.290
So this is what we have so far.

03:19.460 --> 03:27.320
We could begin to maybe go to vertex mode and maybe grab some of these points and begin kind of pulling

03:27.320 --> 03:28.010
them up.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.060
You can see how we've got kind of a kind of a side burn here.

03:32.090 --> 03:33.310
You could maybe move that up.

03:33.320 --> 03:41.630
We could maybe move this in so we could begin to just kind of generally re shape this until we get it

03:41.870 --> 03:43.510
kind of the way we want it.

03:43.520 --> 03:52.980
I mean turn on the move tool here and kind of pull this out like this I can press control three to go

03:52.980 --> 04:00.120
to the left or the graphic view and do the same over here I could hit G and move these around a bit

04:02.890 --> 04:06.770
like this maybe bring this one down.

04:06.770 --> 04:10.030
So I'm like that and this one backs.

04:10.540 --> 04:14.710
So just generally getting the proper shape.

04:14.710 --> 04:17.440
Let's take a look at this here.

04:17.470 --> 04:20.650
So we really need to bring these up now.

04:20.710 --> 04:30.520
I think I may go back to solid and select this one right here and we can also see through the mesh without

04:30.520 --> 04:37.420
hitting the Z key and going to wireframe we can just press all Z and then we get kind of a transparency

04:37.420 --> 04:38.080
here.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.200
So that can help us switch back and forth.

04:41.230 --> 04:54.460
Let's say I grab these and make it all easy and select this again like this and this could kind of move

04:54.490 --> 05:03.310
these up a bit and maybe move these in they're just trying to mold it just a little bit better because

05:03.310 --> 05:11.590
what we're gonna do next is use that subdivision surfaces modifier again to get it a little bit more

05:11.740 --> 05:17.380
smooth more rounded with a little bit more resolution.

05:17.410 --> 05:19.190
Let me bring these in.

05:20.390 --> 05:23.460
I mean like this.

05:23.630 --> 05:24.970
Let's bring that up some

05:28.240 --> 05:28.780
okay.

05:28.790 --> 05:39.220
So I'm just still kind of shaping it maybe I should grab these and bring these up like this all right.

05:39.220 --> 05:41.190
So we've got a basic shape.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.510
Now it's not looking too bad.

05:43.510 --> 05:48.090
There's still some points in here that we could pull around a bit.

05:48.160 --> 05:53.950
I'm just going to kind of tumble around and see where I need to pull things in or out.

05:54.970 --> 06:01.890
Yeah I think I had I think I could maybe pull this in some like this when we go.

06:02.060 --> 06:02.360
All right.

06:02.380 --> 06:06.820
So I think we're doing pretty well here is just the basic shape of it.

06:06.920 --> 06:12.370
Now let's go back to that front view and make sure it's about the right size.

06:12.380 --> 06:14.920
Yeah I think that's pretty good.

06:14.960 --> 06:15.380
All right.

06:15.380 --> 06:23.300
So now what let's do before we add that next subdivision modifier let's add some thickness to this and

06:23.300 --> 06:25.300
see how it's going to look.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.500
Let me tab back into object mode.

06:27.500 --> 06:36.680
Let's hit the in key to go to our sidebar and let's go ahead and apply the scale press control a and

06:36.680 --> 06:38.540
apply this scale.

06:38.540 --> 06:45.860
Now let's come over here to the modifiers panel add modifier and this time we'll choose solidify.

06:45.980 --> 06:53.520
Now if we click and drag we can see we're gonna get a bit of thickness there like that.

06:53.570 --> 06:54.230
All right.

06:54.230 --> 06:59.990
We could even choose even thickness again that might help a little bit.

06:59.990 --> 07:00.230
All right.

07:00.230 --> 07:01.420
So now we've got it.

07:01.430 --> 07:06.840
So we have a bit of thickness there while we have this modifier here.

07:06.860 --> 07:14.300
Let's go ahead and add another one we can stack them in this modifier stack and we oftentimes get different

07:14.300 --> 07:17.450
results depending on where they are in the stack.

07:17.480 --> 07:23.910
So let me show you if I turn this down a bit and then I'll go ahead and add another modifier.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.510
Let's add a subdivision surface modifier now.

07:27.690 --> 07:34.310
Now you can see it's beginning to curve and be a little bit more rounded the way we have in the picture

07:34.310 --> 07:35.290
here.

07:35.360 --> 07:41.690
So let's see if we get any difference if we change the order we can choose this arrow here to bring

07:41.690 --> 07:44.530
this subdivisions surface up to the top of the stack.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.410
If we click that you can see what happens.

07:47.510 --> 07:57.080
We're subdividing it first on the top and then we're adding a solidify modifier to it without a subdivision

07:57.140 --> 07:57.620
surface.

07:57.620 --> 08:00.610
So we're just getting a flat edge here.

08:00.770 --> 08:07.850
But if we bring this solidify on the top I'm going to twirl these in here if we bring this solidify

08:07.850 --> 08:09.560
up to the top.

08:09.770 --> 08:16.730
We're using this solidify first and then we're subdividing all of it including the solidify part here

08:16.730 --> 08:17.890
on the edges.

08:17.900 --> 08:21.050
So that looks pretty good right there.

08:21.080 --> 08:27.880
We could also come over here to object and shade smooth and that's looking pretty good there.

08:27.950 --> 08:28.250
Yes.

08:28.280 --> 08:31.420
So I think that's going to be pretty good.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.350
I think what we need to do now is just apply the modifiers so in what order should we apply them.

08:39.350 --> 08:41.030
Well let's take a look.

08:41.060 --> 08:48.380
I'm going to come up to the top of the stack here and click apply for the solidify and then I'm going

08:48.380 --> 08:52.180
to click the subdivisions apply.

08:52.210 --> 08:56.570
Now if we tap into edit mode there is the geometry of our hair.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.940
So notice what I did.

08:57.970 --> 09:04.970
I applied the modifiers from the top of the stack down and that does make a difference as well.

09:04.990 --> 09:05.260
All right.

09:05.260 --> 09:09.340
So now we have the basic form of the hair in the next video.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.090
Let's work on shaping it a little more.

09:12.190 --> 09:17.050
And also we'll delete some of the faces on the inside that we're not going to be seeing.
