WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:06.140
I think we're to the point again where we should probably do a little more cleanup if we select say

00:06.140 --> 00:09.030
this object here we can see this is it.

00:09.080 --> 00:15.750
And it's called sphere and that's not quite right let's call it arm and this down here.

00:15.800 --> 00:19.360
We could call it leg and we go.

00:19.370 --> 00:26.520
And also this empty object we can call that reference image.

00:26.530 --> 00:27.160
There we go.

00:27.160 --> 00:34.600
And this collection of items right here we could change the name of that as well and we could just call

00:34.600 --> 00:42.180
this character and sense the reference image is it's kind of is its own thing.

00:42.190 --> 00:49.450
Actually we could just select this scene collection up top right click and create a new collection and

00:49.450 --> 00:57.790
call this reference and we could just take that empty and drag it into that collection there and that

00:57.790 --> 01:00.310
cleans the outline or up just a bit.

01:00.430 --> 01:07.470
And also what we could do now is we could go ahead and hide the character right here just so we hide

01:07.470 --> 01:08.910
that whole thing.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.770
And then if I select the scene collection and create a new object with this selected it will create

01:15.760 --> 01:21.570
it outside of the character collection so we can still see it in the 3-D view.

01:21.600 --> 01:29.190
So for the hand let's go ahead and create a cylinder we can see here that's pretty much a cylinder so

01:29.190 --> 01:34.980
let's press shift a and create a cylinder here.

01:35.430 --> 01:37.380
We don't need 32.

01:37.380 --> 01:42.410
Let's take it down to 16 and for the cap fill we don't need anything.

01:42.420 --> 01:51.480
So let's just choose nothing and we go now well let's do is turn it in the x all press are x 9 0 and

01:51.480 --> 01:55.340
hit enter and now let's go to that front view again.

01:55.560 --> 02:04.410
And if I go to wireframe right here we can see that cylinder in the view I'll hit G and move it up to

02:04.410 --> 02:10.870
about here where the hand is going to be and then I'll hit s and scale it down quite a bit so we get

02:10.870 --> 02:13.220
it just generally the right size.

02:13.330 --> 02:15.580
It doesn't have to be perfect at this point in time.

02:16.420 --> 02:18.760
So maybe about like that.

02:18.790 --> 02:19.660
All right.

02:19.660 --> 02:28.390
So now if we tumble around and hit the Z key and go back to solid view it looks like the hand isn't

02:28.390 --> 02:35.420
quite this deep soulless press s and y and maybe scaled down just a bit like this.

02:35.540 --> 02:44.030
And with that opening here on the bottom maybe we should delete a few frames or a few faces down here

02:45.330 --> 02:54.190
with tab in the edit mode and hit the three key maybe we can choose these bases right down here and

02:54.190 --> 03:02.470
let's hit X and delete bases and there we go so now we've got that basic shape now there's a bit of

03:02.470 --> 03:05.760
a curve here on the back of the hand.

03:05.800 --> 03:13.870
So let's let's work on that if we get the one key and go to vertex mode and we select this vertex and

03:13.870 --> 03:17.790
this one we can move these forward like this.

03:18.010 --> 03:25.230
But the other ones need to come along and to do that what let's use is the proportional editing tool

03:25.240 --> 03:31.470
so up here you can see if you pull this menu down you have the proportional editing tool.

03:31.480 --> 03:35.210
We can enable it here by clicking this.

03:35.290 --> 03:42.280
And now if I hit G you can see let me scroll the mouse wheel and like this you can see we've got the

03:42.280 --> 03:51.010
area of influence right here so if I move around you can see the influence changes as I scroll this.

03:51.010 --> 03:56.320
Now I'm going to hit the escape key to get out of that and what I want to do is just pull it forward

03:56.380 --> 04:03.290
only so I'll press G and y and just pull forward like this.

04:03.430 --> 04:10.180
Now I will scroll the mouse wheel and see if I can get it a little bit more curved like this.

04:10.180 --> 04:17.740
We don't have a whole lot of polygons to work with here but we can still get kind of a hint of a curve

04:17.770 --> 04:22.960
here I think maybe something like this.

04:22.960 --> 04:23.380
There we go.

04:23.380 --> 04:27.630
So we have that kind of curve there at the at the back of the hand.

04:27.640 --> 04:27.940
All right.

04:27.970 --> 04:33.190
So now that we've done that we can go ahead and turn off the proportional editing tool and we can do

04:33.190 --> 04:34.900
that with the shortcut.

04:34.910 --> 04:38.560
Oh so I'll just hit 0 and that'll turn that off.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.820
Now let's give it some thickness.

04:40.870 --> 04:47.410
We can do that by tapping back into object mode and coming over here to the modifiers panel right here

04:47.890 --> 04:54.730
and click Add modifier and we can go to solidify if we click here you can see it just added a little

04:54.730 --> 04:57.360
bit of thickness there but not a whole lot.

04:57.520 --> 05:03.760
If we hit the end key and take a look at our scale and our rotation they aren't ones and zeros.

05:03.760 --> 05:11.230
They they have some non uniform values here and we really need uniform values in our scale and rotation

05:11.260 --> 05:14.950
when using a modifier like this solidify modifier.

05:14.950 --> 05:22.840
So let's once again press control a and let's choose rotation and scale in the apply menu.

05:22.840 --> 05:28.190
And when we do that you can see the thickness gets a little more pronounced.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.980
It's more even.

05:29.980 --> 05:34.490
We could also come over here and click on even thickness and that helps as well.

05:34.510 --> 05:40.660
But now what let's do is click on this thickness field and click and drag and bring that in some and

05:40.660 --> 05:47.290
I'll even hold the shift key down as I click and drag and that'll make things a little bit smoother

05:47.920 --> 05:53.960
as I drag that in maybe something like this and we go.

05:54.230 --> 06:01.120
Now if I tab into edit mode you can see this thickness is just kind of a preview.

06:01.190 --> 06:07.610
It isn't real per say we can come over here and turn it off and turn it on in the viewport to bake this

06:07.610 --> 06:09.160
geometry into the object.

06:09.170 --> 06:13.830
We need to tab back into object mode and come over here and click apply.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.520
So I'll do that.

06:15.590 --> 06:20.140
And now you can see all that geometry is there.

06:20.180 --> 06:20.420
All right.

06:20.420 --> 06:28.840
So let's now go back to that front view with the one key and if we grab these edges here I'm just going

06:28.840 --> 06:34.040
to grab this one edge and I just want to hit G and move it like this.

06:34.070 --> 06:43.040
So we have a bit of this point or flat part here and I'll grab this edge as well go back to that front

06:43.040 --> 06:46.940
view and hit G and just move that up as well like that.

06:46.940 --> 06:47.320
OK.

06:47.360 --> 06:56.030
So we're getting there we have that basic shape now I'd like to add a bevel or two both at the tip of

06:56.030 --> 07:00.840
the finger type areas here and along the edges.

07:01.070 --> 07:07.600
And I think what I need to do first is this fingertip area before I do that.

07:07.610 --> 07:14.300
Let me go to the vertex tool and just select these vertices right here and I want to pull them back

07:14.330 --> 07:22.780
so they line up again when I dragged that edge in it kind of through these out of alignment.

07:22.880 --> 07:23.290
Here we go.

07:23.320 --> 07:27.080
So I just want to bring those back just a little bit like that.

07:27.100 --> 07:27.400
All right.

07:27.910 --> 07:37.520
So now if I go to edge mode and I select this edge and this edge let's go ahead and Bevel these I'll

07:37.670 --> 07:46.020
press control B and drag the mouse out to about like this let's say and then I'll add a few segments

07:46.020 --> 07:52.770
here and just click and there we go then we can make that a little bit bigger if we want by clicking

07:52.770 --> 07:55.370
and dragging on the width.

07:55.500 --> 08:00.220
I don't think I want it quite that big maybe something like that.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.460
I think I better make it more like this.

08:02.490 --> 08:03.240
There you go.

08:03.260 --> 08:09.370
OK so now I'll go ahead and select these edges along here without click.

08:09.380 --> 08:19.460
Alt shift click here and in here and then I'll come around to the back and alt shift click these back

08:19.460 --> 08:22.230
here as well like that.

08:22.460 --> 08:30.070
So we select all of those all at once and now with all that selected I'll press control B again and

08:30.070 --> 08:34.810
let's add another little devil right in here.

08:34.850 --> 08:42.540
I don't think I need this many I can take this down to three maybe yeah let's try that and there we

08:42.540 --> 08:42.810
go.

08:42.810 --> 08:48.150
So now we've got those devils all the way around.

08:48.360 --> 08:52.830
And in addition let's go ahead and try and smooth these.

08:52.830 --> 08:53.930
All right.

08:53.940 --> 08:56.730
Click choose shade smooth.

08:56.730 --> 08:59.220
And that helps quite a bit actually.

08:59.220 --> 09:02.020
Let's go over to the object data.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.440
Turn on auto smooth.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.860
You can see an edge right there.

09:06.900 --> 09:12.330
That's not too bad but I think what I'll do is go ahead and slide that up a little bit more and try

09:12.330 --> 09:14.160
and get rid of those.

09:14.430 --> 09:16.740
So we don't see that.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.220
All right.

09:18.250 --> 09:28.520
Also I feel like this edge right here those could be pulled forward just a bit right in here.

09:28.550 --> 09:34.420
This and this but I'll need to drag these forward as well.

09:34.430 --> 09:37.990
So what let's do is just go to wireframe.

09:38.080 --> 09:45.980
The one key to go to vertex mode and then and then I'll come over here choose the select tool click

09:45.980 --> 09:53.330
and drag these go back to the move tool and maybe pull these in just a little bit like this.

09:53.390 --> 09:55.300
Let's see how that works.

09:58.950 --> 09:59.140
Yeah.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.840
That may have helped a bit.

10:00.850 --> 10:01.700
Okay.

10:02.020 --> 10:10.420
So now that we have the basic shape of the hand in the next video what let's do is create the wrist

10:10.540 --> 10:13.930
coming out of the hand that will then insert into the sleeve.
