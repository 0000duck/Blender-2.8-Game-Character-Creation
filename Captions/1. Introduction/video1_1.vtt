Hi welcome to blender 2.8.

00:02.990 --> 00:04.690
Game character creation.

00:04.820 --> 00:10.160
I'm Darren Lyle a Blender Foundation certified trainer and in this course we're going to create this

00:10.160 --> 00:16.940
character and one of the cool things about it is that we're going to incorporate both blenders 3D tools

00:16.940 --> 00:25.340
here and the new 2D grease pencil animation as well so that in one interface we can animate both the

00:25.340 --> 00:29.700
3D body and the 2D face.

00:29.720 --> 00:32.600
It's a lot of fun and it's worth checking out.

00:32.630 --> 00:39.260
In addition we'll take this character into unity and set him up as a game character so that when we

00:39.260 --> 00:48.050
run the game right here we'll be able to run the character around the environment jump and just have

00:48.050 --> 00:49.690
some fun with him.

00:49.820 --> 00:53.260
Now all the resource files are included with this course.

00:53.270 --> 01:00.440
So the Unity project the blender scene files are all included as well as the textures and the sprite

01:00.440 --> 01:07.040
sheets that we create for the 2D base animations we go through a lot of material in this course from

01:07.190 --> 01:16.160
modeling and texturing rigging animation and even writing a C sharp script in unity so the Course does

01:16.160 --> 01:23.300
assume at least some experience with Blender and unity but we'll go through every part of the process

01:23.570 --> 01:24.630
step by step.

01:24.800 --> 01:30.230
So hopefully it's a smooth learning curve right through the end of the process creating a character

01:30.230 --> 01:31.990
like this is always a lot of fun.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.940
So if you're ready let's get started.
