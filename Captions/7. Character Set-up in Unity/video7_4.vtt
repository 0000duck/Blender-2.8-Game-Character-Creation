00:00.500 --> 00:06.290
To test the retargeting on our character let's bring in a character from the asset store.

00:06.290 --> 00:09.680
So I'll come over here to the asset store in unity.

00:09.680 --> 00:13.550
And we're just going to bring in the standard assets.

00:13.650 --> 00:20.520
These are free assets that come with unity that you can use for testing or or games or for anything

00:20.520 --> 00:21.450
you want.

00:21.450 --> 00:29.100
I'm going to type in standard assets here in the search field and then here we are standard assets unity

00:29.120 --> 00:29.810
technology.

00:29.820 --> 00:34.940
So I'll click that and I've already downloaded this.

00:34.960 --> 00:40.210
If you haven't you may get a download button here and then you'll have to click import.

00:40.210 --> 00:48.500
But for me I'm just gonna click import here and this will import all of these downloaded assets into

00:48.500 --> 00:53.340
our unity project here.

00:53.350 --> 00:58.390
Now there's a lot here and we're certainly not going to use everything but instead of going through

00:58.390 --> 01:02.320
and trying to figure out only the things that we want I'm just going to import all of it here.

01:02.420 --> 01:06.560
I'll just click import.

01:06.660 --> 01:07.050
All right.

01:07.050 --> 01:13.470
So now that has been imported let's go back to our same view here and under our assets Boulder we've

01:13.470 --> 01:16.870
got this new folder called standard assets.

01:17.100 --> 01:25.550
And in here we've got a folder called characters and in here we've got a third person character.

01:25.680 --> 01:29.070
Let me open that up and under prefabs.

01:29.070 --> 01:30.280
This is what we want.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.280
Third Person controller.

01:32.280 --> 01:39.390
Now what I first need to do is create a ground plane a floor for these guys to move around on.

01:39.450 --> 01:47.460
So let's come over here and go to game object and 3D object and plane and we go let's take this down

01:47.460 --> 01:54.460
to 0 0 0 0 tabs 0 tab 0 and we go.

01:54.450 --> 01:57.180
And I want to make it a little bit bigger.

01:57.180 --> 02:05.010
This isn't quite big enough to run around on I don't think let's take the scale of this up to 5 in the

02:05.010 --> 02:15.110
x and 5 in the z that just gives us more room to play with their and then what let's do is take this

02:15.140 --> 02:21.980
third person control or prefab and drag it up here into the hierarchy and there we go.

02:21.980 --> 02:29.270
Now when I hit the f key and zoom in now there is the character that we brought in from our standard

02:29.270 --> 02:30.110
assets.

02:30.320 --> 02:33.350
If we click play I'm just gonna come up here and hit the play button

02:37.780 --> 02:39.580
and use the arrow keys.

02:39.580 --> 02:43.180
We can run this guy around.

02:43.370 --> 02:43.760
Where do you go.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.110
There he is.

02:45.560 --> 02:54.330
So we can run him around with the arrow keys and we can hit the spacebar and jump and hit the C key

02:55.020 --> 03:01.440
and duck so we've got some pretty good animations here with the idol the run the jump.

03:01.600 --> 03:06.800
So let's see if we can get these animations going on our character.

03:06.850 --> 03:09.520
I'll hit the play button here and turn that off.

03:10.690 --> 03:16.510
Now keep in mind that when when you're animating a character you're really animating for that particular

03:16.720 --> 03:17.650
body type.

03:17.650 --> 03:25.480
Those proportions so not all animations are going to work on all characters and that's sometimes what

03:25.480 --> 03:31.270
you need to test before you decide on what kind of animations you want to use or if you want to use

03:31.270 --> 03:34.950
your own animations will like we're going to do here in a bit too.

03:34.960 --> 03:42.040
In addition if we go back to our assets window and choose to player idle you can see here that we've

03:42.040 --> 03:49.990
got warnings and if we scroll down under this import messages you can see here that what it's saying

03:49.990 --> 03:56.710
is that this particular problem might lower the retargeting quality that it's having a problem with

03:56.710 --> 04:04.600
spine to to recall that that's the chest bone and it's having trouble figuring out the rotation of that

04:04.600 --> 04:04.990
bone.

04:04.990 --> 04:08.900
So that could be a problem when we do the retargeting here.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.100
That might not work but it's a good test.

04:12.190 --> 04:15.820
It's a good process to go through and a good thing to know.

04:15.850 --> 04:22.830
So you know you can find animation say on the asset store and try them out on your character.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.050
All right.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.040
So how do you do that.

04:24.040 --> 04:28.420
How do you retarget an animation from one character to another.

04:29.170 --> 04:34.510
Well the first thing you need to do is I'm going to take our character this player Idol and I'm going

04:34.510 --> 04:42.070
to drag it right on top of this third person controller and that basically parents it or creates a parent

04:42.070 --> 04:50.200
child relationship with this third person controller and it's got a lot of components here that's helping

04:50.200 --> 04:52.510
it move around in the scene.

04:52.540 --> 04:59.320
So by parenting this to this third person controller we're going to allow our character to use all of

04:59.320 --> 05:03.990
this information to use the animations the scripts et cetera.

05:04.090 --> 05:10.480
And the main thing that's driving the character the animations is this animator and you can see here

05:10.480 --> 05:17.780
that the animator has a third person animator controller and it's got an avatar the Ethan avatar.

05:17.790 --> 05:25.230
Now if we come over here to our character and scroll this one down we see we've got an armature this

05:25.230 --> 05:27.150
one up here has a skeleton.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.920
We've got our character.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.390
They've got the body here.

05:30.390 --> 05:37.320
So it's a similar setup but if I choose the player idol you can see we have an animator here as well.

05:37.470 --> 05:40.140
But we do not have an animator controller.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.650
We've got our player idle avatar.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.230
That's good.

05:43.230 --> 05:46.410
That was created when we imported it in.

05:46.800 --> 05:53.940
But we don't have a controller and in fact what we want to do is remove this animator completely so

05:53.970 --> 05:57.780
it defaults to the animator up in the third person controller.

05:57.870 --> 06:03.400
So let's click on the little gear here and choose remove component.

06:03.420 --> 06:06.810
Now this is going to default up to the top.

06:06.830 --> 06:12.240
And what we need to do in this third person controller we need to change the Avatar.

06:12.510 --> 06:21.020
We want to click on this little circle and come over here and choose our player idle Avatar right there.

06:21.030 --> 06:23.260
Now let's close this.

06:23.280 --> 06:28.250
Now we need to take away the body and the glasses of the Ethan character.

06:28.320 --> 06:32.970
We could just delete these but I think what I'm going to do is just come over here and uncheck them

06:32.970 --> 06:38.380
right here and I'm going to select the glasses and uncheck those here.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.600
So those are hidden away or disabled in the scene view.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.800
All right.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.760
So let's give this a try now.

06:45.840 --> 06:52.310
If I click the play button let's see what happens well look at that.

06:52.320 --> 06:56.780
Now can you see him he's actually going through the idle animation if I hit the arrow keys.

06:56.790 --> 06:58.560
I'll hit the down key.

06:58.590 --> 07:01.240
Here he comes so there we go.

07:01.240 --> 07:05.130
We have read targeted the animation to our character.

07:05.140 --> 07:07.780
But take a look at how he's standing.

07:07.780 --> 07:14.470
The knees are pulled in the arms are straight down the animations don't always work from one character

07:14.470 --> 07:20.740
to another so it isn't a strict one to one thing you can just create any old character and grab any

07:20.740 --> 07:23.820
old animation and it will work perfectly.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.840
It isn't quite like that.

07:25.840 --> 07:32.550
We can turn him around here areas and I can hit the spacebar.

07:32.580 --> 07:35.110
There's our jump.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.480
I can hit the C key.

07:37.490 --> 07:38.660
There's our duck.

07:38.660 --> 07:41.100
You can see it's really pulling away here.

07:41.150 --> 07:48.620
So this is kind of an extreme example of how not all animations are going to work with all animated

07:48.620 --> 07:52.250
characters but I wanted you to see how it works.

07:52.310 --> 07:57.980
Just so you can test it out and there are other animations on the asset store that you can use and give

07:57.980 --> 07:58.780
this a try.

07:58.790 --> 08:00.560
It's it's kind of fun.

08:00.710 --> 08:03.650
So I'll go ahead and hit the play button to stop that.

08:03.800 --> 08:11.330
And now what we should do is work on bringing our own animations in and setting up our animations for

08:11.330 --> 08:13.070
our character here.

08:13.070 --> 08:15.020
So that's coming up in the next video.
