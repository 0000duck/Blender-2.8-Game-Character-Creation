WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:03.850
Let's now set up our 3-D character in unity as well.

00:04.020 --> 00:10.890
If we come over to the Inspector I've chosen the player Idol and over here in the rig section we've

00:10.890 --> 00:13.350
got two different animation types that we can use.

00:13.350 --> 00:19.020
Well actually we have a couple but the two main ones here are generic and humanoid.

00:19.020 --> 00:27.730
And if we choose humanoid and we click apply you can see it's gone through and in the configure settings

00:27.790 --> 00:35.410
we get a checkmark which means yes it's actually been approved as a humanoid character and that's good.

00:35.410 --> 00:41.180
But over here real quick it's saying that a material is being used as a normal map.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.800
You can see hair normal.

00:42.850 --> 00:45.790
It's saying that it needs to be marked as a normal map.

00:45.790 --> 00:49.810
So we just need to click pics now so we can do that there.

00:49.810 --> 00:50.690
OK.

00:50.770 --> 00:55.030
So over here if we click configure we can kind of see what it's trying to do.

00:55.040 --> 01:02.600
Let me click this and now we can see our character here in the 3D view.

01:02.740 --> 01:10.000
If we click all right and left click you can tumble and then you can click the middle mouse button to

01:10.000 --> 01:10.920
pan.

01:11.140 --> 01:15.200
And of course scroll the mouse button to Zoom.

01:15.310 --> 01:23.350
But what it's done is it's gone through and taken a look at our rig and it's tried to match up the bones

01:23.350 --> 01:31.990
that we created with its standard default bones that it wants to use within the humanoid rigging system.

01:31.990 --> 01:40.000
And this rigging system is really so that you can create a character and then apply and retarget animations

01:40.000 --> 01:46.650
save from the Unity assets store or anywhere as long as it's configurable by the system.

01:46.660 --> 01:52.670
So having a character that works with the humanoid system here really kind of opens up the possibilities

01:52.690 --> 02:00.820
of using animations from all over but it doesn't always work great because it assumes that you've got

02:00.820 --> 02:07.950
a very standard humanoid character a character with one head two legs two arms fingers and thumbs.

02:08.050 --> 02:13.960
And if you don't have that like our character here we don't have hands and fingers and thumbs we have

02:13.960 --> 02:16.750
kind of these big claw type things.

02:16.990 --> 02:18.930
Look at what it tries to do.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.750
Let me scroll down here.

02:20.980 --> 02:30.080
Look at what it's done it's tried to shape our Lego claw hands into some sort of hand that it can recognize

02:30.560 --> 02:31.950
and it didn't quite work.

02:32.180 --> 02:36.770
So let's come over here to the left hand here and let's take a look.

02:36.770 --> 02:43.520
So it thinks it sees a ring finger and a pinky and that's why it's put them one right next to another.

02:43.580 --> 02:48.170
We could go through and try and change these to a thumb.

02:48.170 --> 02:48.440
Right.

02:48.440 --> 02:53.030
We could use thumb one for the thumb proximal.

02:53.030 --> 02:55.420
We could use them two for the thumb.

02:55.430 --> 03:01.760
Intermediate and that might work but I really don't think it's going to help us a whole lot what I think

03:01.760 --> 03:04.120
we need to do is just remove these.

03:04.250 --> 03:09.680
So the system isn't trying to do this and to do that you can just come over and click on the little

03:09.890 --> 03:13.950
circle here and then scroll up and click none.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.160
So that's what I'm going to do.

03:15.170 --> 03:22.530
I want to go ahead and just take all of these out none on the click on this one here scroll up choose

03:22.530 --> 03:23.520
none.

03:23.520 --> 03:30.370
So I need to go through and do all of these for each of the fingers and each of the hands here.

03:30.370 --> 03:33.850
So when I click this one and scroll that up and none.

03:33.940 --> 03:34.630
So there we go.

03:34.630 --> 03:37.440
So now it isn't going to try and do that.

03:37.550 --> 03:47.240
And over here as well let's click on the right hand and let's tell it to not even try just to not even

03:47.240 --> 03:50.420
try with our fingers for these hands

03:53.960 --> 03:54.380
all right.

03:54.390 --> 03:55.530
And none.

03:55.530 --> 03:56.010
There we go.

03:56.010 --> 04:02.090
So we've taken those out of the running we're not even going to allow unity to deal with that at all.

04:02.130 --> 04:07.830
As for say the body and the head it all looks pretty good.

04:07.830 --> 04:15.590
It's found bones that it can use in the head here too and it all looks pretty good.

04:15.630 --> 04:23.730
So now that we've configured that the way we want we can scroll down here and click apply and then done

04:26.020 --> 04:27.470
and then we go.

04:27.660 --> 04:32.490
Now in addition we need to set up the animation for this particular character as well.

04:32.490 --> 04:36.160
So if I click animation let's take a look at this.

04:36.180 --> 04:39.100
Now we have a lot of things going on here.

04:39.210 --> 04:45.450
A lot of actions that have come over from blender that unity is seeing as possible animations.

04:45.450 --> 04:48.180
And we know that this just isn't the case.

04:48.180 --> 04:56.790
We only created this one from zero to 143 it's actually from one to 144 but it's seeing it here as zero

04:56.790 --> 05:00.330
to 143 so we need to reconfigure all of this.

05:00.390 --> 05:02.820
So let's do is just begin at the top.

05:02.820 --> 05:10.410
And let's just delete these with the minus button here I'll click that and that again and again and

05:10.410 --> 05:13.050
again I want to keep this one here.

05:13.050 --> 05:16.390
But then these two can go away like that.

05:16.410 --> 05:17.010
All right.

05:17.070 --> 05:19.330
So this is just the idol.

05:19.340 --> 05:22.650
We'll just call this idol and we go.

05:22.650 --> 05:30.810
And if we scroll down we can see how unity is trying to figure out if this particular animation loops

05:30.900 --> 05:36.200
if it's a cycling animation and it is we know it is because that's what we set it up to be.

05:36.210 --> 05:43.110
So we want to turn on loop time here and it's seeing that the beginning of the animation in the end

05:43.110 --> 05:46.290
of the animation match in order for it to loop.

05:46.290 --> 05:49.340
So that's why we're getting these green lights over here.

05:49.420 --> 05:57.710
Let's go ahead and click apply here and now we've got our idle animation setup we can click down here

05:57.710 --> 06:05.720
and hit play and you can see the idle go through its animation and it looks pretty good

06:08.480 --> 06:15.320
I'll hit pause here and now what let's do is let's bring it into the 3D view here and setup the materials

06:15.350 --> 06:22.580
and the textures so to do that I'm going to just take this player idle and drag it up into the hierarchy

06:22.580 --> 06:29.530
window right up here and there we are there's our character we need to give it a material because the

06:29.530 --> 06:33.460
material in Blender didn't come through properly here.

06:33.760 --> 06:41.450
We need to come down here and right click shoes create and create a material.

06:41.510 --> 06:50.420
Let's do that and let's call this character I can then take this material drag it over here and just

06:50.480 --> 06:53.810
drop it right on the character and there it is.

06:54.930 --> 07:01.020
If we come over and click on our player Idol object over here and scroll down here we can choose our

07:01.290 --> 07:09.620
character and you can see the material here so it's been attached as a component to our character in

07:09.620 --> 07:17.300
the inspector panel here I'll twirl this down and what we need to do is add our color map to the albedo

07:17.300 --> 07:21.700
channel and our normal map to the neural map channel.

07:21.710 --> 07:22.670
So let's do that.

07:22.670 --> 07:30.610
Let's grab our character base color and drag it right over into here and we want our hair normal dragged

07:30.610 --> 07:34.750
right into the normal map here and then we go.

07:34.750 --> 07:39.670
So now you can see the colors the textures.

07:39.670 --> 07:43.690
You can see the sculpt information up here in the hair.

07:43.690 --> 07:46.080
So that's that's looking pretty good.

07:46.090 --> 07:51.580
The only thing I'd like to do is maybe scroll out here and this directional light here you can see it

07:51.580 --> 07:52.380
here.

07:52.420 --> 07:58.540
If we select that I think what I'd like to do is just click on the rotate tool and let's just turn that

07:59.470 --> 08:04.040
until we can see our character a little bit better there we go.

08:04.110 --> 08:05.400
Something like that.

08:05.460 --> 08:09.990
So I click on him and I'll hit the f key to frame that up.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.030
There we go.

08:12.060 --> 08:12.670
All right.

08:12.750 --> 08:17.610
Now we need to put some materials on the face objects as well.

08:17.610 --> 08:21.650
Let's do that if I come over here into the hierarchy.

08:21.660 --> 08:24.540
I can search for things with a particular keyword.

08:24.550 --> 08:26.920
So I'm just going to search for face.

08:27.270 --> 08:30.570
And now you can see the three objects that have face in them.

08:30.570 --> 08:32.200
So this face idle.

08:32.220 --> 08:32.950
Here we go.

08:33.030 --> 08:40.770
What I need to do is create a material for this so I'll right click choose create material we'll call

08:40.770 --> 08:50.360
this face idle m80 so then let's just take this base idle material and drag it over here you can see

08:50.360 --> 08:55.040
the blender material is still on here but it's having trouble dealing with it.

08:55.310 --> 09:03.360
So we'll just take this new unity material and drag it over here and drop it and that will replace that.

09:03.380 --> 09:05.470
So let's go over to the face.

09:05.480 --> 09:18.110
Jump let's create a new unity material we'll call this base jump in 80 I'll select the object drag the

09:18.110 --> 09:28.100
material onto it and then we go we can see it there one more let's create a new material and we'll call

09:28.100 --> 09:30.030
this face run.

09:30.170 --> 09:36.700
You may t select the object and drag it on.

09:36.740 --> 09:38.370
There we go.

09:38.380 --> 09:38.710
All right.

09:38.740 --> 09:43.630
So we've got the idol jump and the run.

09:43.630 --> 09:50.260
OK so now let's just click on the X here to remove that search term and there we go.

09:50.260 --> 09:57.210
Now we're back here and what we can do is we can change the type of material these are.

09:57.240 --> 10:03.990
So if I choose that base idol material it's currently a standard material and what we're actually going

10:03.990 --> 10:13.110
to need for this ultimately is an unlit transparent material and I'll go ahead and change that over

10:13.110 --> 10:13.930
here too.

10:14.070 --> 10:15.690
Here's the jump.

10:15.780 --> 10:25.730
We'll call this unlit transparent and the run unlit transparent.

10:25.980 --> 10:28.770
So that's what we're gonna need for those.

10:29.070 --> 10:35.160
Now while we're working with the 3D character we can go ahead and disabled these I can select this and

10:35.460 --> 10:42.460
uncheck this and that will remove it from the 3D view at least temporarily while we're working with

10:42.460 --> 10:44.220
the 3D character.

10:44.220 --> 10:50.660
And then we go OK so we have our character brought into unity.

10:50.690 --> 10:52.810
We have some materials created.

10:52.910 --> 10:56.360
We've applied our textures in the next video.

10:56.390 --> 11:01.080
Let's see what that humanoid rigging system can actually do for us.

11:01.160 --> 11:07.550
We'll go into the unity assets store get some character animations and apply it to our character to

11:07.550 --> 11:08.360
see how it works.
