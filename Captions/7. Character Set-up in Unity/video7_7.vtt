WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:05.240
All right now let's try and see if we can get the face animations to work.

00:05.280 --> 00:07.170
There are a couple of parts to this.

00:07.170 --> 00:14.750
First we need to modify the script here to turn on and off the appropriate base object.

00:14.820 --> 00:24.300
So when the idle animation is running we need to only have the face idle on here we need to have it

00:24.450 --> 00:32.470
enabled here and win the jump is activated we need to activate the jump here et cetera.

00:32.480 --> 00:35.510
So that's what we'll be doing in this script.

00:35.510 --> 00:37.340
Just turning them on and off.

00:37.340 --> 00:40.850
That's all to actually play the animations.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.250
We're going to have to create yet another script.

00:43.280 --> 00:48.040
And this one is going to be one that we can find out on the web.

00:48.260 --> 00:58.680
So let's first go grab that if you go to wicked dot Unity 3D Dot Com and search for animating tile texture.

00:58.750 --> 01:06.430
You'll find this page that has a few different scripts to run through a tiled texture a sprite sheet

01:06.720 --> 01:09.910
and animated on an object as a texture.

01:09.910 --> 01:16.990
So if we scroll down here there are a few that are fairly basic scripts but there's one down here right

01:16.990 --> 01:17.230
here.

01:17.230 --> 01:20.350
This animated tiled texture extended.

01:20.350 --> 01:21.430
This is the one I want.

01:21.430 --> 01:23.020
This is pretty detailed.

01:23.020 --> 01:27.970
It's got a lot going on in it and it has quite a few settings that we can adjust.

01:28.090 --> 01:31.600
Once we attach the script to our player object.

01:32.530 --> 01:39.240
So what I'm to do is just go ahead and grab everything underneath this public class line here.

01:39.240 --> 01:45.640
I'm just going to grab this curly bracket and I'm just going to click and drag all the way down to the

01:45.640 --> 01:51.070
bottom of this script right down here.

01:51.110 --> 01:54.140
I don't need this part down here or this one.

01:54.170 --> 02:00.560
I'm just going to end right here and I'm gonna press control C to copy it to my clipboard.

02:00.560 --> 02:09.980
Now back in unity I'm going to create a new script in my scripts folder a C sharp script and I'll call

02:09.980 --> 02:20.750
this animate tiled texture and if I open this up we get the base default template here and I just want

02:20.750 --> 02:29.150
to delete everything under that public class and press control the and there we go.

02:29.260 --> 02:34.020
Now there are a couple of things that's going to happen here this is an older script.

02:34.120 --> 02:40.900
So what happens is anytime we see this renderer here this is an older way of doing things.

02:40.900 --> 02:47.050
You can see what we actually need is this Get component renderer parentheses.

02:47.050 --> 02:52.420
So what let's do is let's just go ahead and type that in and then we'll copy and paste from that.

02:52.480 --> 02:57.230
So get component renderer parentheses we go.

02:57.430 --> 03:09.320
Let's just delete this type and get component and then we'll type in renderer and then open and close

03:09.320 --> 03:19.150
parentheses and then we go so now let's just select this let's just highlight this control C to copy

03:19.800 --> 03:30.600
and anywhere where we see renderer let's just paste this in here's one here here's one here

03:36.520 --> 03:37.750
and all the way down here.

03:37.750 --> 03:48.220
Looks like we have quite a few huh so this just happens as unity is updated scripts become out of date

03:49.500 --> 03:53.430
and we sometimes have to update them in this way.

03:54.090 --> 03:59.360
So let me grab this and paste that

04:02.560 --> 04:04.060
looks like we've got one more here

04:06.760 --> 04:08.240
control the paste.

04:08.330 --> 04:16.970
OK so that's all we did is just replace the word renderer with get component renderer parentheses.

04:16.970 --> 04:18.220
That's it.

04:18.230 --> 04:26.880
So let's come up here now and let's save and we go and now let's go back to unity and I'll go ahead

04:26.910 --> 04:34.610
and select one of these base objects I'll select the face Idol and I'll turn that on.

04:34.650 --> 04:40.460
Let's go ahead and hit the X here to come out of that search mode.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.740
So currently we have the face idle object enabled.

04:44.740 --> 04:48.610
We've got our unlit transparent shader on it.

04:48.610 --> 04:55.180
And now what I want to do is just take this script and just drag it and drop it right over here.

04:55.180 --> 04:58.390
Now we have a lot of settings here that we can use.

04:58.390 --> 05:04.450
We aren't going to use all of them but what I do want to do is make sure that our sprite sheet is in

05:04.450 --> 05:06.320
here in the shader.

05:06.430 --> 05:10.910
So let's come over to our textures and this idle sprite sheet.

05:10.930 --> 05:19.680
We need to click and drag right into here and drop there and you can see then all the different images

05:19.980 --> 05:23.370
in our animation here on the face.

05:24.420 --> 05:31.140
So what it's going to do is that script is going to try and animate through this whole thing and project

05:31.140 --> 05:33.870
that onto that base object.

05:33.870 --> 05:43.260
So if we open this up again I'll just double click that we have two four six eight ten twelve fourteen

05:43.320 --> 05:50.250
sixteen images across and three six nine images down.

05:50.250 --> 06:01.680
So what let's do is go ahead and plug in 16 columns by nine rows right here and our frames per second

06:01.740 --> 06:04.060
is 24.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.050
And we want to play on enable.

06:06.050 --> 06:10.730
So whenever this is enabled we want to play this animation.

06:10.890 --> 06:11.880
So let's give it a try.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.360
Let's see what happens.

06:13.430 --> 06:14.910
I'll come over here and hit play

06:18.930 --> 06:19.720
and there he is.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.200
Look he's blinking.

06:22.200 --> 06:27.100
He's idling and looking around all at the same time.

06:27.100 --> 06:30.340
So what we're doing here is we're animating our 3D object.

06:30.520 --> 06:38.130
And as you can see we're animating the 2D images all at the same time pretty cool.

06:38.170 --> 06:47.530
All right so let's go ahead and hit the play and stop it now what let's do is select the face jump and

06:47.530 --> 06:51.170
let's also add that animation as well.

06:51.220 --> 06:59.490
So over here in the shader let's grab that jump sprite sheet and drag that into the texture here.

06:59.490 --> 07:05.700
Now if we open this up we can see we've got two four six eight by four.

07:05.700 --> 07:06.050
All right.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.850
So let's plug that in.

07:07.950 --> 07:14.290
We need to take that script here and our scripts folder and drag it over here.

07:14.290 --> 07:15.880
There we go.

07:15.900 --> 07:20.950
And so we said what eight by four or.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.860
And we also want it to be 24 frames per second.

07:24.970 --> 07:27.930
And in addition we want it to play on enable.

07:27.940 --> 07:36.940
So when we hit the spacebar we will put into the script to disable the face object and enable the jump

07:36.940 --> 07:38.190
object.

07:38.200 --> 07:42.990
Now for the run object we don't need a whole lot here.

07:43.030 --> 07:46.540
We just need that single image of the face in here.

07:46.540 --> 07:48.100
I don't think I've brought that in yet.

07:48.130 --> 07:51.400
So let's go over to our textures folder.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.970
Let's right click.

07:53.050 --> 07:58.720
Let's go to import new asset and that's probably going to be in our renders here.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.900
Here's the run.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.140
And there it is.

08:01.210 --> 08:01.810
Let's click.

08:01.810 --> 08:03.720
Import.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.180
Here we go.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.580
Now we need to tell it what type of image it is.

08:07.580 --> 08:12.530
Let's go over here and let's call it a sprite.

08:12.570 --> 08:14.550
It's a single image.

08:14.550 --> 08:20.010
And the max size can be 256 and let's apply.

08:20.990 --> 08:21.290
OK.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.980
So there he is.

08:22.980 --> 08:31.560
Let's now grab that face run object over here and let's click and drag and drag that run base image

08:31.590 --> 08:33.030
right in there.

08:33.110 --> 08:35.180
There we go OK.

08:35.210 --> 08:42.230
So we're all set up with our textures and our animating script in the next video.

08:42.230 --> 08:51.290
Let's work on modifying that player script so that when we hit the up arrow we kick off the face animation

08:51.290 --> 08:54.030
for the run when it's at zero.

08:54.050 --> 09:01.070
We play the face animation for the idol and when it's at 2:00 we play the face animation for the jump.
