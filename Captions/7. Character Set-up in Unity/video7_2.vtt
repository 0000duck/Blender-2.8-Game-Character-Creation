WEBVTT

00:00.640 --> 00:07.780
To create our sprite sheets we're gonna use the free trial version of a program called texture Packer.

00:07.780 --> 00:11.340
And you can get that here at Code in web dot com.

00:11.530 --> 00:17.980
And what this will do is it will take all those individual images and it will put them on one single

00:17.980 --> 00:28.120
image that we then bring into unity until unity how to split it up how to cut it up into the 144 individual

00:28.240 --> 00:30.190
images that we need.

00:30.220 --> 00:36.790
So all I've done is I've just downloaded the free version of texture Packer here and then if we open

00:36.790 --> 00:43.090
it up we get presented with this screen here and we can of course purchase the pro version we would

00:43.090 --> 00:46.130
have to purchase the key and then enter it here.

00:46.240 --> 00:52.750
But for this project all we really need is just the free version so I'll click here and here we are.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.960
So this is texture Packer.

00:55.030 --> 00:59.600
What we need to do is bring in our images over here into this column.

00:59.620 --> 01:05.800
So what let's do is come up here to add sprites and here's our jump.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.650
Let's begin with that idol.

01:07.720 --> 01:12.910
Let's go in here and here's all of our frames for our idol to select all of them.

01:12.910 --> 01:20.160
I'm just gonna press control a and then click open and here are all of our frames.

01:20.380 --> 01:27.520
Now it's packed it in just automatically in kind of a strange way I don't want all of these turned sideways.

01:27.520 --> 01:32.890
This isn't quite what we need and what texture Packer is gonna do here is it's gonna try and tell us

01:32.920 --> 01:38.590
that we need the pro features to do this but all we really need to do is just change the algorithm over

01:38.590 --> 01:41.740
here to the basic algorithm.

01:41.740 --> 01:42.940
There we go.

01:42.940 --> 01:49.300
And then what I'm going to do is change the max size and for this for our one hundred and forty four

01:49.480 --> 01:59.860
images at 256 pixels I choose forty ninety six and then take this trim and change it to none.

01:59.880 --> 02:00.660
Here we go.

02:00.660 --> 02:08.670
Now we've got a very nice sprite sheet with all of the blocks filled or all of the tiles filled.

02:08.790 --> 02:14.610
If I would have left the animation at one hundred and forty three frames this one frame would have been

02:14.610 --> 02:20.670
blank and therefore we would have gotten a little flash at the end of each of the cycles.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.760
And that would have been kind of distracting in unity.

02:23.760 --> 02:28.090
So this is why I needed one hundred and forty four so we would come out even.

02:28.110 --> 02:31.330
So we'd get a fully tiled sprite sheet.

02:31.380 --> 02:37.260
Now it's telling us down here that we don't have a particular tool enabled because we don't have the

02:37.260 --> 02:38.380
pro version.

02:38.400 --> 02:43.140
That's fine let's just disable the feature there and then we go.

02:43.140 --> 02:44.910
So this is what we want.

02:45.180 --> 02:47.200
Now we need to do is publish it.

02:47.250 --> 02:51.200
Let's come up here to publish sprite sheet like there.

02:51.270 --> 03:00.110
And here in our exports we can go ahead and call this maybe idle underscore sprite sheet.

03:00.110 --> 03:04.100
There we go and now we can click OK.

03:04.110 --> 03:04.950
All right.

03:05.070 --> 03:06.080
Well that wasn't too bad.

03:06.090 --> 03:07.950
Let's go ahead and try the other one.

03:07.950 --> 03:11.270
I'm going to come up here and go to file new project.

03:11.490 --> 03:14.920
Let's add some sprites right here.

03:14.980 --> 03:18.460
I mean this time let's go take a look at the jump.

03:18.470 --> 03:19.370
Here we are.

03:19.370 --> 03:23.780
So I'll press control a and click open.

03:23.870 --> 03:29.960
Now once again we need to do a bit of adjusting here so let's go over here to the algorithm and change

03:29.960 --> 03:31.980
that to the basic.

03:32.570 --> 03:39.320
For our max size I think we can keep it at 2048 because we don't have as many images for the trim.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.660
Let's go ahead and choose none.

03:41.780 --> 03:42.820
And there we go.

03:42.830 --> 03:44.610
So that looks pretty good.

03:44.630 --> 03:48.330
I'll go ahead and disable this here so we don't get that.

03:48.350 --> 03:54.830
Now you may be wondering I I did all that work previously with the idol to make sure that we had all

03:54.830 --> 03:57.210
the tiles build on our sprite sheet.

03:57.380 --> 04:00.050
And yet here we've got two that are empty.

04:00.050 --> 04:05.990
Well the reason why I don't care too much about this is this isn't going to be a cycling animation.

04:06.080 --> 04:12.500
So the Idol will be repeating again and again whereas with the jump it'll just be one time.

04:12.500 --> 04:18.850
So the animation will begin as he begins to jump and then it will end as he hits the ground.

04:19.130 --> 04:22.810
And then if he jumps again it'll begin from the beginning again.

04:22.850 --> 04:28.880
So we didn't need to fill this up completely because it won't be looping continuously.

04:28.880 --> 04:29.360
All right.

04:29.390 --> 04:33.530
So let's go up here to publish sprite sheet.

04:33.700 --> 04:34.400
There we go.

04:34.400 --> 04:44.480
And for this let's call it Jump underscore sprite sheet and OK for the run.

04:44.640 --> 04:45.920
It's just a single image.

04:45.930 --> 04:48.200
So we don't need to worry about that too much.

04:48.210 --> 04:52.410
We can just bring in that single image and use it as is.

04:52.600 --> 04:57.090
All right well let's go over to unity and bring these in and see if we can set these up.

04:57.430 --> 05:04.040
So back in unity here let's right click in the assets folder and we'll choose important new asset.

05:04.060 --> 05:14.090
And over in our exports we can choose the idol and jump sprite sheets and we go all right.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.590
Well now let's set these up.

05:15.590 --> 05:22.400
If I choose the idol sprite sheet over here in THE INSPECTOR We have some settings that we can use to

05:22.520 --> 05:28.000
enable unity to see this as a single image with multiple sprites.

05:28.070 --> 05:36.730
So as our texture type we want to change this from default to sprite and as I said we want our sprite

05:36.730 --> 05:43.280
mode to not be single we want to see this as a sprite sheet with multiple sprites on it.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.590
So let's choose multiple.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.490
We also made this sprite sheet.

05:47.640 --> 05:48.980
40 ninety six.

05:48.990 --> 05:53.630
So we need to change the max size to forty ninety six here.

05:53.800 --> 05:57.000
Natalie click apply.

05:57.110 --> 05:58.440
You can see it here.

05:58.490 --> 06:06.650
So we have the image setup but now we need to tell unity how to cut it up how to slice it into 144 individual

06:06.650 --> 06:07.520
images.

06:07.550 --> 06:10.880
So to do that we come over here to our sprite editor.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.110
We open this up.

06:12.110 --> 06:14.090
We can see our image here.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.550
And if we come up to slice we can tell unity how we want to cut it.

06:17.690 --> 06:27.050
So I click slice and instead of automatic we want to choose grid by cell size So currently the pixel

06:27.050 --> 06:29.570
size is at 64 by 64.

06:29.570 --> 06:34.940
We rendered these out at 256 by two fifty six.

06:34.940 --> 06:42.910
So now if we click slice it will cut it up into one hundred and forty four images that are exactly 256

06:42.910 --> 06:49.770
by 256 so if I select one here you can see this one is two fifty six by 256.

06:50.020 --> 06:52.620
And so are all the others right.

06:52.660 --> 06:56.140
So these are all now exactly the same size.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.940
And that's what we want.

06:57.970 --> 07:01.210
So now that we've done this let's come up and click apply

07:04.290 --> 07:05.160
and there we go.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.890
All right let's close this.

07:07.530 --> 07:10.770
And now we have our idle sprite sheet set up.

07:10.770 --> 07:15.590
You can see if we twirl it down now you've got all the individual images here.

07:15.730 --> 07:16.320
And that's good.

07:16.320 --> 07:23.910
So in one image in one sprite sheet we've brought in all of these single individual images and that

07:23.910 --> 07:28.340
will save a lot of processing time when the game is running.

07:28.380 --> 07:35.420
So if this character is in a game having these setup in one sprite sheet is a lot more efficient.

07:35.430 --> 07:35.700
All right.

07:35.700 --> 07:40.020
So let's choose jump and let's go through the same process here.

07:40.080 --> 07:46.270
So over here we want to choose sprite let's choose multiple images.

07:46.420 --> 07:52.600
And down here our max size is correct because we set this up at 2048 so we don't need to do anything

07:52.600 --> 07:53.420
there.

07:53.470 --> 07:56.860
Let's just click apply there's our sprite sheet.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.700
Now we just need to tell unity how to cut it up.

07:59.700 --> 08:08.610
Let's go to our sprite editor and we'll click on slice we've still got 256 by 256.

08:08.610 --> 08:09.740
That's good.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.220
Let's click slice here.

08:12.270 --> 08:17.470
Now if we click on any one of these you can see they are all the same size.

08:17.550 --> 08:26.880
OK now let's come over here and click apply and then close the window and there we go.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.210
All right.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.720
So that's how we set up our sprite sheets in the next video.

08:30.720 --> 08:35.010
Let's work on setting up our 3D character in unity as well.
