WEBVTT

00:00.690 --> 00:06.540
So to prepare for exporting I think the first thing we should do here for the jump animation is to render

00:06.540 --> 00:11.140
the 2D face animation out just like we did for the others.

00:11.370 --> 00:17.370
So to do that we need to make sure that our grease paint object is enabled and all the others we still

00:17.370 --> 00:21.220
have disabled in the render and that's good.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.000
We go over to our output.

00:23.010 --> 00:27.360
We still have two fifty six and 24 frames per second.

00:27.390 --> 00:29.690
We do need to change our output path here.

00:29.700 --> 00:39.360
So let's click on the folder icon here and let's go to our renders folder and let's create a jump folder

00:39.420 --> 00:47.920
or create a boulder here we'll call it Jump and if we select that now we can choose accept.

00:48.130 --> 00:51.080
And that's where the renders are going to go.

00:51.250 --> 00:58.360
In addition over in the renders panel we still have under film we have our alpha at transparent and

00:58.360 --> 00:59.050
that's good.

00:59.710 --> 01:08.870
So what let's do is let's just go ahead and come up here and choose render and render animation and

01:08.870 --> 01:09.790
there it goes.

01:12.150 --> 01:12.510
All right.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.930
Let's see how we did.

01:13.950 --> 01:24.760
Let's go over to that renders folder right here here's our jump and there's our jump image sequence.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.110
So that's good.

01:26.110 --> 01:27.190
That's what we want there.

01:27.970 --> 01:35.170
So now that we have that let's think about how we're going to get this guy out to unity.

01:35.170 --> 01:39.330
First of all let's go ahead and save this and let's make a copy of this.

01:39.340 --> 01:51.040
So let's go over to file save copy and we want to go to exports and we'll call this player underscored

01:51.040 --> 01:51.580
JUMP

01:54.320 --> 01:59.780
RIGHT HERE AND SAVE AS THERE WE GO.

01:59.820 --> 02:08.490
So we know that we can go back to those files and export the 3D body out from each of those files.

02:08.490 --> 02:12.210
And actually what we're going to be doing is really using the animations.

02:12.330 --> 02:19.620
We'll only be using the 3D character from say the idol blend file and we'll only be using the animations

02:19.620 --> 02:21.610
from the other two.

02:21.690 --> 02:28.140
So let's begin that let's let's begin exporting our 3D character and animations out what I would do

02:28.140 --> 02:36.000
is go over to file and open and we'll go to those exports and let's go ahead and open up the player

02:36.030 --> 02:37.080
idle.

02:37.110 --> 02:43.050
This will be our main file that will house all of our 3D objects.

02:43.050 --> 02:53.250
So we're gonna want to enable the geo face idle the geo base jump and the run.

02:53.250 --> 02:59.820
We don't need the grease pencil object there but we're going to need the character.

02:59.820 --> 03:07.960
The three base objects and the armature and what we're gonna do is use an FBI X format that's really

03:07.960 --> 03:15.300
kind of the industry standard now to transfer models with animations from one program to another.

03:15.340 --> 03:24.400
So what let's do is let's choose our character and then I will shift select the base Idol base jump

03:24.700 --> 03:27.390
base run and the armature.

03:27.550 --> 03:28.480
We need all of those.

03:28.870 --> 03:36.090
So let's now go over to file and export and let's choose FBI x.

03:36.140 --> 03:39.210
Now I'm going to make sure I'm in my exports.

03:39.230 --> 03:42.080
I've got player Idol FBI X that's good.

03:42.380 --> 03:43.940
Over here on the side.

03:43.940 --> 03:51.330
Now we want to choose selected objects only right here we go over to our armchairs.

03:51.600 --> 03:59.870
I'm going to choose only deform bones and uncheck the leaf bones and then if we go back to the main

03:59.930 --> 04:09.050
option here down here I only want armature and mesh so I'll shift click that and everything else I think

04:09.050 --> 04:10.180
is fine.

04:10.190 --> 04:17.000
So now here in my exports folder click export FBI X and then we go.

04:17.180 --> 04:19.860
Now let's go do that for the other two.

04:19.910 --> 04:32.080
I'll go over here to file open and let's work on the run or I'll open that and with this as well we

04:32.080 --> 04:34.090
need to enable these.

04:34.390 --> 04:36.780
So I can see them and select them.

04:36.850 --> 04:43.790
So we're gonna choose the character the base Idol jump run and the armature.

04:43.810 --> 04:44.590
All right.

04:44.680 --> 04:50.120
So now we come over here bile export FBI.

04:50.440 --> 05:01.850
We want the selected objects we want the deformed bones and we want the armature and the mesh.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.310
All right we've got player run FBI x.

05:04.370 --> 05:08.140
Let's export this out all right.

05:08.160 --> 05:14.090
Now let's go over to the jump file open work on the jump.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.630
Open that up.

05:15.630 --> 05:17.170
Same thing.

05:17.310 --> 05:20.520
It's select all of these.

05:20.680 --> 05:25.450
We can hide the grease pencil here it doesn't really matter but if it's in the way you can always hide

05:25.450 --> 05:25.750
that.

05:26.440 --> 05:39.420
So once again let's choose the character based Idol jump run armature file export FBI X once again down

05:39.420 --> 05:50.510
here we want to choose a selected object only the deformed bones the armature and the mesh all right.

05:50.710 --> 05:52.090
Here we go.

05:52.090 --> 05:55.760
Player jump FBI X export.

05:55.950 --> 06:01.650
All right well let's go open up unity and see if we can bring all this in all right.

06:01.650 --> 06:09.830
I've opened up unity and I'm going to call this Lego character and I'll call it unity so we know that

06:09.830 --> 06:14.680
this folder contains all of the unity assets here all in one folder.

06:14.690 --> 06:22.970
So I've got it set up at the correct path here I've chosen 3D for my template and I'll just choose create

06:23.030 --> 06:25.960
project.

06:26.200 --> 06:32.170
All right here in Unity now let's go ahead and bring in those exports down here in the assets window

06:32.170 --> 06:42.150
right here I'm going to right click and choose important new asset here in my main folder I'll come

06:42.150 --> 06:51.600
over here to exports and let's bring in the idle the jump and the run FP x files I'll just click import

06:51.600 --> 06:53.370
here and there we go

06:56.060 --> 07:03.800
also let's bring in all of our textures I'll right click import new assets and let's go get our textures

07:03.800 --> 07:08.410
here this and this import those

07:13.120 --> 07:18.490
and also we're going to need to bring in those rendered images right we're going to need to bring in

07:19.000 --> 07:26.170
I mean go to import new acid here we're going to need to bring in all of these how do we bring in all

07:26.170 --> 07:31.900
of these if I just drag all of these in it'll fill up the assets folder and we really won't be able

07:31.900 --> 07:39.040
to use them what we need to do is we need to convert all of these images to a sprite sheet and then

07:39.040 --> 07:45.820
we can bring in that single sprite sheet for the idle animation and let unity pull the images from that

07:45.820 --> 07:50.260
single sheet so we will work on that coming up next.
