WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:03.750
ALL RIGHT NOW LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET THIS GUY moving around.

00:03.850 --> 00:11.290
If we go back into our players script what we can do is create another couple of variables one for our

00:11.290 --> 00:14.020
speed and one for our turn speed.

00:14.020 --> 00:22.800
So up here let's create another public variable here and let's make it a float and let's call it speed

00:24.090 --> 00:27.250
and let's make this equal to I really don't know.

00:27.340 --> 00:34.520
We're just gonna have to try it and see what's going to work what speed is going to work and when we

00:34.520 --> 00:36.740
create these public variables.

00:36.860 --> 00:40.160
What happens is they become available to us in the inspector.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.360
So let me save this.

00:42.530 --> 00:50.480
And if we go to our player idol you can see that over here those public variables show up as adjustable

00:50.480 --> 00:53.000
settings over here in the inspector.

00:53.000 --> 01:01.490
So we'll be able to change our speed or gravity jump force whatever we need here as we test our character.

01:01.490 --> 01:03.750
All right let's go back to that player script again.

01:04.040 --> 01:13.920
And we also need turn speed so let's create a public float we'll call it turn speed and we'll set this

01:13.920 --> 01:22.640
to I don't know 50 as well we'll just go with that press control act to save it.

01:22.990 --> 01:29.670
And now down here in the update function we need to apply those speed variables when we run.

01:30.490 --> 01:38.930
So what let's do is write in here we can say that that move direction that we created earlier should

01:38.930 --> 01:40.130
transform

01:42.900 --> 01:52.670
forward when we get input from the vertical input.

01:52.670 --> 01:54.990
So let me show you what I mean by this.

01:55.130 --> 01:57.640
What unity will do.

01:57.860 --> 02:00.410
Well before I do that let me just add.

02:00.590 --> 02:02.280
Times speed.

02:02.290 --> 02:14.990
Here we go so if we come over here into unity and we go to edit project settings and we look at our

02:14.990 --> 02:22.940
inputs here let me open this window up just a little bit scroll down the axes we can see that that vertical

02:22.940 --> 02:28.130
here actually coincides to the up and down arrows on the keyboard.

02:28.130 --> 02:38.180
So when we put in vertical and we go back to that script here when we put in vertical what we're saying

02:38.180 --> 02:43.160
is look for input from the up or the down arrows.

02:43.280 --> 02:50.090
And when you get that input move it forward at the speed of this speed variable.

02:50.090 --> 02:51.360
That's all we're doing here.

02:51.380 --> 02:59.630
We're just using Unity's preset names for the inputs and likewise for horizontal.

02:59.630 --> 03:05.110
You can see here that we've got the left and the right keys as well.

03:05.120 --> 03:05.360
All right.

03:05.360 --> 03:12.860
So let me close that go back to our script and so to use that horizontal what we can do is we can say

03:13.910 --> 03:29.300
that we can turn if we get input get access from anything that is by default part of that horizontal

03:29.300 --> 03:38.880
input we go so we can just say the turn is going to be acquired from those horizontal inputs and lastly

03:38.880 --> 03:42.560
we can say that we want to turn in what axis.

03:42.570 --> 03:49.440
So if we get input from those horizontal keys the left or the right around which axis are we going to

03:49.440 --> 03:59.800
turn so we can say transform rotate and here we need to plug in the three different axes so the axes

03:59.800 --> 04:04.300
are X Y and Z.

04:04.550 --> 04:15.260
So we want to turn around the y axis so we can have the x and z be zero but the y we want to turn and

04:15.260 --> 04:17.900
multiply it by that turn speed

04:21.490 --> 04:28.690
and multiply it by that time dot delta time so it turns at a constant rate and doesn't fluctuate with

04:28.810 --> 04:35.330
the variable frame rate time dot delta time.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.160
And there we go.

04:37.190 --> 04:46.270
So this right here should allow us to move forward at the variable speed and also turn in the y axis.

04:46.340 --> 04:47.630
So let's copy this.

04:47.630 --> 04:57.270
Control C analysts move this down into the else right down here and since the else is the idol when

04:57.270 --> 04:59.090
we aren't moving at all.

04:59.190 --> 05:09.380
Let's change the speed to zero so we want to be able to do all of this but just not move forward.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.690
All right let's give this a try.

05:10.690 --> 05:11.820
I'm in a press control.

05:11.820 --> 05:20.240
Best to save the script and now let's go back to unity and I want to do a couple things before I begin

05:20.360 --> 05:22.300
testing the movement.

05:22.520 --> 05:27.380
First of all this big white plane isn't real good for seeing movement.

05:27.380 --> 05:33.410
We need something on the plane some sort of texture so we can see that we're moving across it easily.

05:33.410 --> 05:38.050
And what I've done is I've dragged into my textures folder.

05:38.180 --> 05:45.320
This checkerboard pattern and I'm just going to drag it and drop it onto that ground plane and we go

05:45.330 --> 05:50.870
so now we have something that we can see the movement a little easier.

05:50.870 --> 05:56.990
I'm going to select it and then come over here to the shader and I want to change the tiling here from

05:57.290 --> 06:00.570
from one to five by five.

06:00.570 --> 06:00.820
Yeah.

06:00.830 --> 06:03.200
That makes it a little bit smaller.

06:03.230 --> 06:08.390
So now we'll be able to see the movement across the plane a little bit easier.

06:08.390 --> 06:14.530
Secondly I really don't need this camera parentage to my character anymore.

06:14.540 --> 06:22.110
So I'm going it's going to take this and drag this out of that hierarchy and here it is now here.

06:22.110 --> 06:29.400
But I really want the camera to follow the character as he moves around and the great thing about the

06:29.490 --> 06:37.200
standard assets that we downloaded from the asset store a couple of videos ago is that it has this camera's

06:37.200 --> 06:38.370
folder in it.

06:38.580 --> 06:43.740
And then if we go to prefabs it's got this multi-purpose camera rig.

06:43.950 --> 06:45.420
And this is pretty cool.

06:45.480 --> 06:50.160
So I'm just gonna click and drag this into the hierarchy and you can see there's the camera there.

06:50.160 --> 06:55.860
Now we can't have two cameras in the scene at the same time so I'm going to take this main camera and

06:55.860 --> 06:58.650
hide it just uncheck it here.

06:58.770 --> 07:02.550
So we only have this one as part of the camera rig.

07:02.670 --> 07:10.830
Now the cool thing about this is if you look over here it has a feature to auto target anything that

07:10.830 --> 07:15.230
is tagged as player can see the tags up here.

07:15.300 --> 07:22.950
So if we select our player Idol and come up here to tags it's currently UN tagged but if we tag it as

07:22.950 --> 07:24.570
a player.

07:24.640 --> 07:32.220
Now this multi-purpose camera rig will automatically point the camera at it and follow it.

07:32.450 --> 07:32.740
All right.

07:32.750 --> 07:36.350
So let's give it a try to come up here and hit the play button

07:40.100 --> 07:41.970
and now when we hit the up arrow.

07:42.230 --> 07:42.910
Wow.

07:42.950 --> 07:44.240
And there he goes.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.710
He's really fast.

07:47.090 --> 07:49.010
Let's slow him down some.

07:49.130 --> 07:55.100
I'll hit the play button again and if we choose the player Idol we can come over here into the script

07:55.160 --> 07:58.870
and this speed is way too fast.

07:58.870 --> 08:08.750
So let's maybe take this down to 10 and see how that works we'll hit the play button again and now let's

08:08.750 --> 08:09.920
hit the up arrow.

08:10.070 --> 08:15.810
There he goes a little bit better but he's still pretty fast.

08:15.810 --> 08:22.130
I mean hit the play button again and let's change it to let's try.

08:22.130 --> 08:28.430
Let's try it six and for the turn speed I'm going to take this up to maybe 60.

08:28.460 --> 08:33.900
Let's try this so I'll hit the play button again.

08:33.910 --> 08:34.390
Here we go.

08:34.390 --> 08:40.120
So I mean hit the up arrow and the left arrow.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.590
This isn't bad.

08:41.590 --> 08:42.360
And whoa.

08:42.370 --> 08:43.190
There he goes.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.370
I'd better turn it off.

08:45.370 --> 08:47.400
Let's try this again.

08:47.410 --> 08:52.510
Actually what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit the play button again and let's try and adjust these

08:52.960 --> 08:54.380
while the game is on.

08:54.490 --> 08:55.330
See if that works.

08:55.330 --> 09:02.080
So let's take the turn speed up to 100 and I'll click back into the game view and then I'll hit the

09:02.080 --> 09:03.230
up arrow.

09:03.460 --> 09:08.920
And now that kind of turns a little bit quicker that's a little better.

09:08.920 --> 09:09.460
All right.

09:09.460 --> 09:10.990
And he can jump.

09:10.990 --> 09:11.270
Yeah.

09:11.290 --> 09:12.120
That's pretty good.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.180
Yeah.

09:15.190 --> 09:23.400
This feels a little bit better this bit of the turn is pretty good.

09:23.690 --> 09:26.310
The jump isn't high enough is it.

09:26.330 --> 09:28.160
So let's take the jump force.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.350
Back up too.

09:29.990 --> 09:31.370
Well let's take it back up to 10.

09:31.370 --> 09:38.310
Let's try this click back here up arrow it turns pretty well.

09:38.680 --> 09:44.640
You can see that face animation kick off when he jumps.

09:44.640 --> 09:45.620
Good.

09:45.690 --> 09:52.590
Yeah I like the jump like that it's pretty it's pretty high but I like it yeah.

09:52.740 --> 09:56.520
I think we're doing pretty well.

09:56.580 --> 10:05.240
So what have we got here we've got a jump force at 10 speed at 6 turn speed at 125 so let me turn off

10:05.240 --> 10:05.930
the game.

10:06.800 --> 10:13.890
So here we had 10 and 6 and 125.

10:14.090 --> 10:18.500
Well there's a last few things that we could do to finish up here.

10:18.530 --> 10:23.340
I think one thing we should do is create a prefab of our player.

10:23.390 --> 10:30.350
Remember when we brought in our multipurpose camera rig and the character from the standard assets they

10:30.350 --> 10:37.940
were all in prefabs folders like the character third person prefab.

10:37.940 --> 10:38.830
Right.

10:38.870 --> 10:46.940
And what these are are just game objects that store all of your predefined settings components scripts

10:47.060 --> 10:48.710
all into one game objects.

10:48.710 --> 10:53.900
So we don't have to do it again every time we drag the player into a scene.

10:53.900 --> 11:02.000
So what we could do is go back to our assets here and we could select our player idle and we could just

11:02.000 --> 11:06.800
drag this from here down into the assets folder to create a prefab.

11:06.800 --> 11:10.390
We'll just take this drag it down and there we go.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.660
And it asks us would we like to create an original or a variant.

11:14.660 --> 11:17.000
And I'm going to create an original.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.780
So let's just do that there.

11:18.980 --> 11:24.380
And in addition what we can do is we could grab this ground plane as well.

11:24.380 --> 11:31.650
It's got a material and a texture and a size maybe we want it this same way in a new level.

11:31.760 --> 11:38.990
So we could take our ground plane and drag it down here and it automatically becomes a prefab.

11:38.990 --> 11:45.260
Now we could take these two in the hierarchy and delete them like this.

11:45.480 --> 11:52.950
And now we can just take these and drag them in here's our ground plane and here's our character and

11:53.070 --> 11:58.540
all the settings have been saved in those so if we hit play.

11:58.710 --> 11:59.820
There we go.

11:59.910 --> 12:04.730
It all it all works just the same as it did before.

12:04.740 --> 12:12.660
So creating prefabs is a great way to save all your settings save all your work so you can take this

12:12.660 --> 12:16.530
character or any game asset into other scenes or levels.
