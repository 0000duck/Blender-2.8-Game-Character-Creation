00:00.780 --> 00:06.600
To test our animations on the character I'm going to try and keep things fairly simple mainly because

00:06.600 --> 00:08.840
I'm not an expert programmer.

00:08.850 --> 00:11.730
I don't code or script very well.

00:11.730 --> 00:18.420
I can do it just enough to get things to work to test a character here in Unity but I'm certainly not

00:18.420 --> 00:19.020
an expert.

00:19.580 --> 00:24.900
And if you take a look at this third person controller over here that comes from unity and you take

00:24.900 --> 00:29.450
a look at the third person character script I'm going to click here and choose.

00:29.520 --> 00:36.310
EDIT Script and take a look at the script here.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.420
I'm just going to scroll down here.

00:38.420 --> 00:40.870
There is a lot going on here.

00:41.030 --> 00:50.390
The movement and the leaning when he turns and the crouching and just there's so much here and I'm certainly

00:50.390 --> 00:55.010
not going to go through trying to create a script like this for this course.

00:55.010 --> 00:57.610
And frankly I don't know that I could.

00:57.710 --> 01:00.070
This is some pretty complex stuff.

01:00.170 --> 01:10.880
Also then in addition we have the user controls here for the camera and the controls for a mobile device

01:10.910 --> 01:13.120
and there's just a lot going on.

01:13.120 --> 01:20.060
So I think it's beyond my personal capabilities to go into great detail here I'm not the one to learn

01:20.210 --> 01:28.220
scripting from but what I can do is create a very simple script that will allow us to at least test

01:28.220 --> 01:34.000
our animations on our character run them around and make sure it's all working okay.

01:34.160 --> 01:41.030
And then if I was part of a team that was creating a game I would hand it off then to the actual programmers.

01:41.720 --> 01:48.980
So my interest is really in trying to come up with a very simple script that will at least test the

01:48.980 --> 01:56.090
animations on the character and just like we set up our animations over here in the player idle we're

01:56.090 --> 01:59.230
gonna need to do that for the jump and the run.

01:59.270 --> 02:01.910
We've already tried the humanoid RIG.

02:01.910 --> 02:04.130
I'M GOING TO GO BACK OVER HERE TO RIG.

02:04.130 --> 02:05.780
We've already tried this.

02:05.780 --> 02:14.270
Let's now use the generic because generic is for things that aren't quite humanoid specific.

02:14.270 --> 02:17.180
So maybe it's a dragon with a tail.

02:17.180 --> 02:23.390
Maybe it's a dragon with two heads or something like that or maybe it's a Lego character with weird

02:23.390 --> 02:24.320
claw hands.

02:24.320 --> 02:34.190
So let's go ahead and set our character up generic right here so once I do that I click apply and we

02:34.190 --> 02:41.420
go now let's go over to animation and we've still got our idol here and we don't have all the green

02:41.420 --> 02:47.300
lights down here because the humanoid system isn't trying to figure out whether it's a cycling animation

02:47.300 --> 02:52.370
or not but we do want to make sure loop time is clicked here.

02:52.370 --> 02:57.100
If I hit the play button you can see it go through its animation here.

02:58.980 --> 03:02.910
And it looks pretty good from beginning to end and that's fine.

03:02.910 --> 03:04.970
So let's go and pause that now.

03:04.980 --> 03:07.500
The player jump.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.830
I've already gone through and deleted all of the actions here.

03:10.830 --> 03:14.490
Just like in the idol and I've renamed it jump.

03:14.490 --> 03:16.920
We don't want a loop time here.

03:16.920 --> 03:24.870
So I've uncheck this and for the run I've also gone through and deleted all of those actions renamed

03:24.870 --> 03:33.810
it to run and I've chosen loop time here since that animation that running animation will cycle again

03:33.810 --> 03:34.460
and again.

03:34.500 --> 03:40.070
So if we hit the play button here you can see there he goes All right.

03:40.340 --> 03:49.670
So now that we have our animation setup our rigs as generic what we need to do is setup that animator

03:49.880 --> 03:51.460
for our character.

03:51.460 --> 03:57.350
I'm going to go ahead and delete this third person controller here just go to right click and delete

03:57.800 --> 04:00.610
and that'll just take us back to the beginning.

04:00.620 --> 04:07.970
Now we can take this idol with our new rig settings and drag them up into the hierarchy and drop him

04:07.970 --> 04:08.960
there.

04:08.960 --> 04:13.880
We do need to take our character material and drop it on our guy there.

04:14.570 --> 04:18.740
And in addition let me bring up the face objects.

04:18.740 --> 04:25.510
I'll just type in face there and for these we can go ahead and hide them in the scene.

04:25.550 --> 04:33.200
In fact actually while we're here I'll go ahead and drag the materials on and then disable it in the

04:33.200 --> 04:34.010
scene view.

04:34.010 --> 04:35.100
Here's the jump.

04:35.120 --> 04:38.080
Let's drag that on and disable it.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.500
And here's the run.

04:40.070 --> 04:42.910
Let's drag that over here and disable it.

04:42.920 --> 04:48.340
Okay so now we have our character pretty much all set up the way we had it before.

04:48.350 --> 04:52.520
I'm gonna go ahead and press control s and save our scene.

04:52.550 --> 04:59.680
Now we need to set up the animator here when we re targeted the animation we just removed it.

04:59.690 --> 05:05.150
We just deleted it and use the one in the third person controller but now we have to deal with this

05:05.240 --> 05:12.510
and set it up for ourselves and what we need is an animator controller to go right here in this slot.

05:12.560 --> 05:18.530
So since we don't have one we just need to create one let's go down here and right click choose create

05:19.040 --> 05:27.680
and let's create an animator controller and we go and let's call this player controller All right.

05:27.680 --> 05:31.800
So now we select our player idle up here in the hierarchy.

05:31.970 --> 05:37.310
We can grab that player controller and drag it over and drop it in our animator.

05:37.310 --> 05:41.580
So now we have our own controller and our own avatar.

05:41.620 --> 05:44.700
Now there's more to configuring the animator that we need to do.

05:44.710 --> 05:47.020
We've got an animator tab here.

05:47.020 --> 05:53.470
If you don't see that you can always go to window and animation and animator and that will bring this

05:53.470 --> 05:54.770
up here.

05:54.790 --> 06:02.050
Let's go ahead and go over here and what we need to do is set up the animator in here and we need to

06:02.110 --> 06:09.040
create or drag in an animation that's gonna be our entry animation and then we need to drag in the others

06:09.460 --> 06:11.240
the run and the jump.

06:11.230 --> 06:14.000
So let's go down here to our player idol.

06:14.140 --> 06:19.680
Let's twirl this down and scroll down and we can see that Idol animation here.

06:19.720 --> 06:26.710
That's the one that we've set up in the inspector so going to click and drag and drop and there we go.

06:26.710 --> 06:31.130
Now we've got this initial transition when we hit play.

06:31.150 --> 06:33.780
This is what's going to play first.

06:33.790 --> 06:39.360
You can see over here when we select that transition it says default entry transition.

06:39.610 --> 06:42.580
If we were to hit play now let's see what happens.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.960
I'll play.

06:45.020 --> 06:45.860
So there you go.

06:45.860 --> 06:51.980
You can see him going through his idle animation lets it play to stop that go over to the scene view

06:51.980 --> 06:59.380
and let's move that camera I will select the move tool here and let's just move that camera forward

07:00.130 --> 07:05.500
and then I'll select the rotate tool and I'm just gonna spin it around like this.

07:05.590 --> 07:06.910
You know we go.

07:06.910 --> 07:11.770
In fact I can just come over here and type a negative 180.

07:11.770 --> 07:12.950
There we go.

07:13.210 --> 07:18.980
And maybe I'll go to the move tool again and move it in just a little bit closer like this and there

07:18.990 --> 07:19.470
we go.

07:19.470 --> 07:22.170
So now we can see him now hit play

07:25.050 --> 07:26.030
and there he is.

07:26.080 --> 07:33.260
Now you can see him going through his idle animation and that's all we needed to do to kick that off

07:34.330 --> 07:38.710
if we stop that and go back to our animator.

07:38.710 --> 07:45.190
Now we need to figure out how to use our jump and run animations in here.

07:45.190 --> 07:48.090
Well first of all we need to just drag them in.

07:48.100 --> 07:54.120
So let's scroll down the player jump find that jump animation and let's just drag that in.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.600
There we go.

07:55.600 --> 08:03.340
And then for the run let's scroll this down grab the run and drag that in there too.

08:03.480 --> 08:12.550
And we go so we've got the run the jump and the idle and just like we have this transition going in

08:12.550 --> 08:15.760
from the entry point into the idol.

08:15.760 --> 08:20.140
We need transitions going from idle to run and then back again.

08:20.350 --> 08:27.010
And from idle to jump and then back and also from the run to the jump and from the jump to the run.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.310
So we need to create several transitions here.

08:30.700 --> 08:38.890
And when we do we also need to create a parameter that will allow us in our script to tell unity which

08:38.890 --> 08:42.850
animation to play when a particular key is pressed on the keyboard.

08:42.880 --> 08:49.360
So let's say I push the up arrow on the keyboard we want the run animation to begin.

08:49.630 --> 08:55.000
And if I hit the spacebar on the keyboard I want the jump animation to begin.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.670
So we need a parameter that allows us to tell unity what to do.

08:59.680 --> 09:03.930
What animation to play when we hit a particular keyboard button.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.430
So let's go ahead and create a new parameter.

09:06.430 --> 09:11.050
I'm going to click plus here and I'll create an integer.

09:11.080 --> 09:15.690
Now you can use a boolean I've seen people use boolean and it works just fine.

09:15.700 --> 09:23.470
But in my head I can understand the way an integer works for this a little bit better let's give it

09:23.740 --> 09:24.250
a name.

09:24.250 --> 09:28.420
I'm going to call this annum pa or animation parameter.

09:28.420 --> 09:34.270
And now let's create our transition so let's create our first transition from the idol to the run.

09:34.780 --> 09:37.720
I will right click on the Idol choose.

09:37.730 --> 09:43.300
Make transition pull the mouse down and then left click the mouse.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.460
And that creates that transition.

09:45.580 --> 09:47.370
So let's select it now.

09:47.440 --> 09:51.130
And here we have it going from the idol to the run.

09:51.220 --> 09:59.650
If we hit the play button here we can see him idling and idling and idling and then run.

09:59.660 --> 10:01.980
So that's all we have there.

10:02.020 --> 10:10.660
We want to create a condition here that says if this condition if this integer is one let's say then

10:10.900 --> 10:15.080
he should begin the run he should transition from the idol to the run.

10:15.130 --> 10:20.380
So let's go ahead and hit the plus here we get the animation parameter here since it's the only one

10:20.380 --> 10:21.120
we've created.

10:21.720 --> 10:31.000
And we want to say if the Animation Parameter equals 1 then what it should do is transition to the run

10:32.260 --> 10:36.590
and when this happens we want it to happen immediately as soon as we hit the button.

10:36.700 --> 10:39.340
We want them to begin the run animation.

10:39.340 --> 10:41.320
So we want to turn off exit time.

10:41.320 --> 10:47.630
He doesn't need any exit time from from the idol to the run so I'll uncheck that.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.170
All right so that's good.

10:50.430 --> 10:54.360
But what if he stops running and goes back to THE IDOL HOW DO WE DO THAT.

10:54.720 --> 11:01.300
WELL LET'S right click choose make transition and create a transition back to the idol.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.350
Let's select this one.

11:03.450 --> 11:12.300
Now let's create a condition let's say that if the Animation Parameter is equal to zero then we transition

11:12.300 --> 11:14.970
back to the idol and we do it immediately.

11:14.970 --> 11:17.460
We don't need any exit time here.

11:17.520 --> 11:21.050
So if we have the play you can see he runs.

11:21.090 --> 11:26.580
And then he goes immediately back to the idol animation.

11:26.600 --> 11:26.980
All right.

11:26.990 --> 11:30.880
So we use the integer 1 for the run.

11:30.890 --> 11:34.260
How about we use integer 2 for the jump.

11:34.280 --> 11:41.340
So let's right click on the Idol choose make transition and let's drag this over here and click.

11:41.480 --> 11:50.720
Now for this transition we want the Animation Parameter to equal to how we go.

11:50.720 --> 11:54.500
And we wanted to happen immediately so we'll turn off exit time.

11:54.500 --> 12:02.330
So now if we play he'll Idol and Idol and Idol and then we'll jump.

12:02.510 --> 12:03.430
There we go.

12:03.430 --> 12:04.390
So that's what we want.

12:05.050 --> 12:12.010
Now if he jumps and immediately goes back to the idol animation we need to set up that transition.

12:12.010 --> 12:15.860
So I'll choose make transition drag over here and click.

12:15.880 --> 12:22.690
Now let's select that one and we need to say that if there is a condition where the Animation Parameter

12:22.840 --> 12:27.460
equals zero we go to the idol.

12:27.460 --> 12:27.950
Right.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.070
Just like this one over here.

12:30.070 --> 12:37.450
So anytime the Animation Parameter equals zero it's always going to go back to the idol animation.

12:37.450 --> 12:37.650
All right.

12:37.660 --> 12:42.820
So this one with zero I need to turn off exit time here as well.

12:42.840 --> 12:46.730
Now what happens if we go from the run to the jump or the jump to the run.

12:46.920 --> 12:55.020
Let's make a transition from the run to the jump and Let's select that and let's say that if the Animation

12:55.020 --> 13:02.670
Parameter equals what the jump is to write the idol is zero run is one jump is two.

13:02.670 --> 13:08.550
So if it equals two we want to transition from the run to the jump.

13:08.550 --> 13:11.310
And we want to do it immediately.

13:11.310 --> 13:15.210
And now how about from the jump to the run.

13:15.230 --> 13:20.800
So for this one we want it to be one.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.100
Right.

13:21.100 --> 13:27.680
We want the Animation Parameter to equal one which would take it to the run 0.

13:27.710 --> 13:31.840
And we want to have it happen immediately so we'll turn off exit time.

13:31.930 --> 13:35.640
So basically the idol is zero.

13:35.790 --> 13:40.460
Anytime the Animation Parameter equals zero we're going to transition to the idol.

13:40.850 --> 13:46.170
Any time that parameter is one we're going to transition to the run.

13:46.340 --> 13:51.500
And anytime the parameter is 2 we will transition to the jump.

13:51.510 --> 13:51.880
All right.

13:51.900 --> 13:59.520
So that sets up our animator here what we'll do in the next video is actually begin creating the script

13:59.790 --> 14:06.000
that will allow us to change that Animation Parameter from 0 to 1 to 2 and back again.
