00:00.810 --> 00:04.050
The first thing we're going to need is a few more variables.

00:04.080 --> 00:07.830
You know what let me come down here and I'll just change this.

00:07.830 --> 00:12.090
Maybe I could just type in 125 and let's zoom in a bit.

00:12.090 --> 00:13.110
There we go.

00:13.110 --> 00:16.300
Just makes it a little bigger in the screen here.

00:16.500 --> 00:22.410
So let's create a few public variables that will house our face objects.

00:22.410 --> 00:33.370
So let's create a public game object and let's call one of them run face variable.

00:33.570 --> 00:34.220
How's that.

00:34.720 --> 00:37.600
And let's do the same thing.

00:37.650 --> 00:46.020
Let's just select this and copy this and paste it and we'll call this chump base.

00:46.140 --> 00:55.330
Variable we'll do that again paste and this one can be idle base variable.

00:55.530 --> 00:56.780
There we go.

00:56.780 --> 01:04.250
Now when we first start the game we want to fill those variables with the actual game objects in the

01:04.250 --> 01:05.000
scene.

01:05.060 --> 01:09.530
These geo face objects I mean move this over so these things here.

01:09.740 --> 01:18.740
If I search for these again type in face here and select one we can actually see the path of where they

01:18.740 --> 01:26.770
are they're in the player idle object and they're down in the armature root spine one two neck head.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.510
And finally the face.

01:28.520 --> 01:34.580
Idle object and what we're gonna need to do is put in the script that path so we can tell unity where

01:34.580 --> 01:36.590
to find this object.

01:36.650 --> 01:46.610
So if we come back over to the script here what we want to do is say the run base variable can be found

01:47.300 --> 01:58.420
as a game object game object find in let me put quotes in that because that's gonna be a string we're

01:58.420 --> 02:01.480
gonna need to type in all of this.

02:01.480 --> 02:11.740
So I'll put in a forward slash and we'll call this player underscore idle forward slash armature forward

02:11.740 --> 02:17.680
slash root and on through all of this here.

02:17.730 --> 02:39.820
So we've got a spine one spine to neck add and finally geo face idle so it has to all be just the same

02:39.820 --> 02:43.590
with the same capitals the same spelling and everything.

02:43.660 --> 02:51.600
And then of course a semicolon at the end to end the line we need two more for the jump and the idol.

02:51.670 --> 03:01.180
So I'm just going to grab all of this and press control see control V and let's change this to jump

03:03.230 --> 03:06.440
and we'll change this to jump back here

03:11.770 --> 03:18.830
then let's paste again control V and let's change this one to idle

03:22.650 --> 03:30.600
analysts put Oh we've already got idle here so Oh I see what I did wrong I need to change this to a

03:30.690 --> 03:31.260
run.

03:31.260 --> 03:32.080
There we go.

03:32.130 --> 03:41.190
So we have the run face variable being filled by the GEO face run jump into the jump variable and the

03:41.200 --> 03:43.440
idol into the idol variable.

03:43.470 --> 03:50.310
All right I mean go ahead and click save up here and now we need to tell it what to do when we hit a

03:50.310 --> 03:51.190
particular key.

03:51.180 --> 04:00.720
So if we hit the up arrow key and just as an f y if you want to use the w a and d keys instead of the

04:00.720 --> 04:09.360
arrow keys you can just change this to a W and that will automatically be seen as the w key and the

04:09.360 --> 04:11.430
Andes key will work as well.

04:11.790 --> 04:19.020
So just an aside there just wanted to let you know that now down here in the update what we can do is

04:19.470 --> 04:27.810
say if we press the up arrow we turn on the geo face run object and we turn off the other two.

04:27.810 --> 04:36.780
So to do that we can say run face variable dot set active is true

04:40.380 --> 04:43.200
and then we want to be sure the others are turned off.

04:43.200 --> 04:55.230
So if I copy this and paste it I can say maybe Idol based variable is going to be false

04:58.200 --> 05:12.680
and also I can copy and paste this and this one can be the jump jump bass variable can be false.

05:12.680 --> 05:17.470
So we're turning on the run object and turning off the other two.

05:17.480 --> 05:26.240
All right so let's just copy all of these now control C and if we are grounded what's going to happen.

05:26.240 --> 05:37.450
Well we can paste these and we know that for the idol or 0 here we want the idol to be true.

05:37.550 --> 05:44.070
We want the other two to be false and we go.

05:44.270 --> 05:48.980
Now what happens in the jump well for the jump.

05:49.000 --> 06:00.220
We can paste these and we want the jump to be true and the other two to be false.

06:00.280 --> 06:03.000
We go so let's see what happens.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.620
I'm going to save the script here.

06:05.670 --> 06:07.590
Let's go back to unity.

06:07.620 --> 06:09.560
I'm going to hit that X here.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.160
Turn that off.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.890
I'm going to save.

06:13.080 --> 06:18.380
And then let's hit the play button.

06:18.390 --> 06:18.780
All right.

06:18.810 --> 06:27.240
So we see the idol He's blinking he's idling and looking around now let's hit the run.

06:27.340 --> 06:33.960
I'll hit the up arrow and now he's determined angry or whatever he's supposed to be.

06:34.150 --> 06:37.890
And we go in back to the idol when when I released that.

06:38.050 --> 06:43.240
Now let's hit the jump.

06:43.590 --> 06:44.970
Now why doesn't that work.

06:44.970 --> 06:46.200
Well I have a theory.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.300
Let me hit the play button to turn that off.

06:49.620 --> 06:55.330
And I think it's because if we go back into the player script we scroll down here.

06:55.500 --> 07:03.270
What we have is when the spacebar is pushed and it's grounded we want to begin or enable this jump face

07:03.270 --> 07:07.410
object and as soon as we enable it the animation is going to begin.

07:08.010 --> 07:11.610
Well the problem is is it never comes off the ground.

07:11.700 --> 07:15.960
So as long as it's staying on the ground it's continuing to be renamed.

07:16.320 --> 07:19.140
And every time it's enabled it only plays that first frame.

07:19.140 --> 07:24.900
So it's just being enabled again and again and again and again at every frame.

07:24.900 --> 07:28.140
And that's why it isn't playing the animation to fix that.

07:28.140 --> 07:33.210
What we need to do is get them up off the ground we need to go ahead and create the part of the script

07:33.270 --> 07:36.790
that will push them up for the jump to do that.

07:36.790 --> 07:41.910
Let's come up to the top and let's create a new variable up here.

07:41.910 --> 07:44.690
So we have gravity.

07:44.940 --> 07:54.210
But let's also create a public float for our jump force let's call it Jump force and let's say that

07:54.210 --> 08:02.870
this force is equal to what gravity is 20 let's say the jump force will be 10 so ten point oh f four

08:02.880 --> 08:06.220
float and a semicolon there.

08:06.240 --> 08:15.960
So let's do that and then down in our jump section here we need to push him up in the Y when we hit

08:15.990 --> 08:16.770
the spacebar.

08:16.770 --> 08:28.240
So let's say move direction dot why instead of pulling down like we did down here let's just push up

08:28.390 --> 08:32.100
with jump force.

08:32.140 --> 08:33.410
Here we go.

08:33.410 --> 08:33.670
All right.

08:33.680 --> 08:40.950
So let's save this man I'll go back to unity and if we hit the play button

08:44.480 --> 08:50.840
and hit the spacebar he just jumps right out of frame and we can't see if the animation for the face

08:50.840 --> 08:51.650
turns on.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.400
So what let's do is take this camera.

08:54.500 --> 08:59.270
Let's take the camera and let's just parent it to that object just temporarily.

08:59.300 --> 09:03.320
So when he jumps up the camera will go up as well.

09:03.560 --> 09:08.530
So let's hit play and we hit the spacebar.

09:08.550 --> 09:09.290
There he goes.

09:09.290 --> 09:12.150
You see that.

09:12.310 --> 09:16.170
Now it's continuing on through the animation.

09:16.270 --> 09:21.160
So the problem was he was grounded and all the while he was grounded.

09:21.370 --> 09:28.510
That face object continually became active and therefore continually only began say it frame one.

09:28.540 --> 09:33.390
So it never was able to complete the animation all the way through.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.660
All right.

09:34.660 --> 09:40.780
Well now that we have everything set up we have the run and the jump.

09:40.850 --> 09:43.770
Now what we need to do is get him moving around the scene.

09:43.940 --> 09:45.130
So that's coming up next.
